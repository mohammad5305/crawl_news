      "message": "Improve autofight ranged targeting (and manual aiming, too)\n\nAiming a ranged attack directly at some intended monster is frequently\nmildly sub-optimal; ensuring the attack's path also passes through some\nother monsters afterward (so that it might hit one of them instead if it\nmisses its primary target) is almost strictly better, yet often a bit\nfiddly to bother with. This commit attempts to improve QoL by automating\nsome of this:\n\nOnce autofight has determined a primary target (by its preexisting logic),\nit will attempt to choose the 'best' spot to aim at this target while\nincluding as many other valid targets in the beam path behind it. This\nmeans the player will take better shots in cases those were manually\navailable (especially relevant with piercing weapons, where including extra\nmonsters in the shot path can be very important, yet the player performs so\nmany thousands of attacks each game that manually optimizing every one\nwould be unthinkable).\n\nIn addition, this improves several common pain points regarding statues and\nplants (which could previously cause autofight to cease functioning\nentirely). If an alternate aim exists to the primary target which could\navoid a plant or statue, it will be selected automatically. And in cases\nwhere no such path exists, but some other monster (usually further away)\n*does* have an open path, autofight will choose to target that one instead.\n\nSince these improvements feel so friction-reducing, I have also tried to\nincorporate them into manual aiming. When firing with 'f'/'F' against a\npreviously selected target, a similar automatic aim adjustment will be\napplied to the shot path. Since this can often result in the player's shot\nappearing to be aimed at a different monster than their 'primary' target\n(ie: it aims at something in the back so that both it *and* the original\ntarget can be hit), the interface will only switch its remembered target to\na new monster if the player has moved the cursor in any way. Which is to\nsay that if the player manually aims at a monster, each subsequent use of\n'f'/'F' will focus on that monster, no matter what monster is actually\nunder the cursor after each aim adjustment *unless* the player does any\nmanual adjustment themselves).\n\n-----\n\nThis commit is based on a PR by Odds, to which I added several\noptimisations and fixes and significantly expanded. This closes #4869.",

However, trying to move the altar tracking from the temporary\nposition was failing because the feature type at the temporary position\nwas not that of an altar so the function to move altar tracking\n(move_notable_thing) thought there couldn't be any altar tracking to\nmove. This meant that when you traveled to the closest altar with G_ it\nwould travel to the temporary position (usually the top left corner of\nthe map) if that was closest.",

      "message": "Fix Abyssal rune detection nuking map knowledge\n\nWhen trying to detect the Abyssal rune we would iterate over the whole\nlevel and clear the map knowledge from any square that didn't contain\nthe rune until we found the Abyssal rune at which point we would stop\niterating. So if the Abyssal rune wasn't on the level or it was late in\niteration order we would clear the map knowledge for the whole level.\nThis wasn't a problem for in view squares as the map knowledge would be\nrecreated before the player's next turn. However, for out of view\nsquares because we didn't redraw the tiles it would look as if the map\nknowledge hadn't been cleared until you reloaded the game (which redraws\nthe tiles using the map knowledge) also you could still find items and\naltars etc in these squares when searching as the stash tracker hadn't\nbeen reset for these squares even when these squares appeared blank\nafter reloading.\n\nTo fix this, don't clear map knowledge when trying to detect the Abyssal\nrune as the map kowledge for squares that used to contain the rune but\nno longer do should have been cleared when the rune was removed (along\nwith clearing the rune from the stash tracker etc).",

The non-acquirement\n   weapons care about size, dual-wielding, and sacrificed hands, but\n   are otherwise deliberately as blind to one's character as previously,\n   so that it can still encourage cross-training pivots or demon weapon\n   pick-ups or Paragon wielding without singularly just being one's\n   own choices of weapons. (The acquirement weapons, of course, are\n   still very tailored towards one's own skills.)\n\n * Characters with more Unarmed Combat skill than any weapons skill\n   who can still shapeshift are given more talismans than previously in\n   the weapons / magic / talisman slots.\n\n * Trove spellbooks have a 40% chance to have a second school focus of\n   one's top magic school other than the trove's main magic skill.\n\n * For variety, contrast, and ameloriations of a common bias against\n   heavy weapons all alike, the four classical elements Troves all have\n   additional low manual chances now: Conjurations for Fire, Dodging for\n   Ice, Shields for Air, and Armour for Earth. (Earth's trove has\n   ponderous heavy armour and AC jewellery, Air's trove is themed after\n   the Storm Queen, Fire gets the only offense-forward skill since it has\n   the least general utility in its spells, and Ice gets to round out the\n   set as well as still emphasize defenses for the damage-over-time\n   school.)\n\n * Leda's Sunken Stockpile no longer places as much heavy armour unless\n   one's Armour skill significantly outpaces their Dodging Skill, and now\n   properly works for giving bardings to anemocentaurs and naga.\n\n * Trove consumable drops now have a very small chance for scrolls of\n   acquirement, matching the old chance to get such in old scroll troves.",

The card's also always\nbeen one of the strongest Summoning deck rolls between catoblepae and\ngetting multiple non-hostile summons, so it can take a little bit of a\ndownturn in power anyway.\n\nIn the middle card power tier, fire gets lindwurms over molten gargoyles:\nstill a little boring, but not currently being used up by any\nplayer-accessible Monstrous Menagerie). In the top card power tier, earth\ngets mountainshells over war gargoyles: a unique access to a warded summon,\nand a summon which can do wide AOE damage without hurting allies if one\ncan sufficiently prevent enemies from getting close. This should still be\nreasonably strong, and unique enough to work with alongside plenty\nof other future slow Nemelex adjustments.",

      "message": "First new vault review + new vault tiles for 0.35\n\nTwo new tilesets for vaults, to help slowly push forward on the eventual\ncapacity to help more overflow altars not solely rely on enemies or\nlategame decorative features, as well as to help vaults stand out from a\nvisual default:\n\n* A common necromancy-themed floor set for various undead vaults, reusing\n  ontoclasm's old Crypt floor tiles before they were replaced with\n  CanOfWorms's domino set in d753fea and ebc010b, mixed with CC0 bones\n  by finalbossblues and Denzi's old rough floor + Tomb floor tiles.\n\n* A rare weird demonic rock tile, combining CC0 rpg cliff and vine\n  graphics by finalbossblues with CC0 metal frames and abstracted grass\n  surfaces by surt.\n\nOther notable changes:\n\n* drop_trap (the pressure plate micro-vault that drops spiders, snakes,\n  and klowns) now has slightly less spawns in all three cases, but now\n  also reliably places a staircase near it, allowing it to have more\n  functionality beyond being an obvious trap only to be used for free\n  experience when one can handle the spawns by making the trap interfere\n  with an individual stair and stairdancing by it.\n\n* The vaults_shipping_containers vault series now have a guaranteed\n  minimum of reward and threat deployed within them, as the highlighting\n  of hard V vaults with floor_metal_gold in 011df5c makes it far more\n  conspicuous when they otherwise don't contain any particularly notable\n  threat count.\n\n* Since blade talismans are now potentially a game-winning form for quite\n  a few characters, the Elf:2 Hall of Blades now only contains one 33% of\n  the time instead of 50%, matching the 33% chances for specific talismans\n  from the Crypt shop. As a mild bit of compensation for this, the vault\n  now also contains a 2% chance for a random weapons manual, to allow\n  players to occasionally pivot to the low-investment rare one-handers or\n  to fully invest in the high-investment rare two-handers the vault\n  previously once contained as its loot.\n\n* Some underperforming abyssal rune vaults of the past few versions have\n  been tweaked upwards, due to the increased speed of endgame characters\n  acquiring said rune after 99aa80d being still pretty high even after\n  be59399.\n\n* The moth of wrath Necropolis subvaults have been nerfed once more,\n  including more extensions of surrounding the moth in grates until\n  post-Lair. Additionally, necropolis_ghost_earth_crest now gets a\n  pre_lair_d setting using newer monsters to reduce the presence of both.\n\n* ice_cave_small_demon now has slightly more item rewards, to bring it\n  closer to the rough average of other ice cave rewards.\n\n* Trove and ziggurat entry vaults have been adjusted to reduce lines, as\n  well as making the former clash less visually with Shoals when placed\n  there.\n\n* To let the player ghost + negative energy Ziggurat floor set not get\n  completely derailed by orbs of entropy, said orbs have a bit lowered\n  weighting in that set, and are instead highlighted in a new acid themed\n  Ziggurat floor set.",

      "message": "Fix strange behavior with West Wind rampage shot and pacified monsters\n\nIf the player rampaged towards a neutral enemy while worshipping a god that\nwould be upset for attacking them, the game would still partially act as\nthough you'd fired this shot (pushing monsters back, giving a Salvo stack,\nand seeming to fire an arrow), but the arrow would only travel a single\ntile, ensuring it could never hit anything.\n\nThe cause of this was rather opaque but essentially one part of ranged\nattack code was seeing that the attack would hit a monster that could cause\npenance and treated the attack as though it was aimed with . (at the tile\nimmediately next to the player), but the wind shot tracer itself saw it as\nan enemy that could be hit, and treated it as if it was a valid shot.\n\nI am fixing this by making stop_at_allies itself also stop before neutral\nmonsters that would upset your god (the fact that it didn't already\nprobably meant it was possible to get Ely penance with Valour sword beams,\nbut now should not.) and also causing the auto_abort argument of\ndo_player_ranged_attack to imply the use of stop_at_allies automatically.",

      "message": "Implement the South Wind (stabber)\n\nThis wind (granted by the player's highest skill being either stealth or\nshort blades) causes the player's effective stealth to be increased by 50%\nwhile rampaging and also causes any successful stab against an enemy to\nmake your next rampage movement (that *doesn't* push anything, ie:\nnon-stampede) take no time. In other words, dispatching something\nstealthily can allow you to 'chain' between nearby targets in a whirlwind\nof death.\n\nThe high-roll potential of this is very flashy, though the average case is\nlikely weaker than the other winds. However, in my experience, rampage is\nalready such a natural stabber synergy that less incentive is required to\nmake the player actually want to rush in - after all, while casters and\narchers would normally prefer to hang back, stealth stabbers *already*\nwant to get into melee as rapidly as possible in many cases. And this\nsynergizes with most existing stab-enablers without obviating the need for\nthem.\n\n(I admit to having some concerns over how unbounded instant chain stabs\nmight be with Usk, but it's also very flashy and fun, and I'm not certain\nhow to curtail the wildest excesses without kneecapping it in the average\ncase - ie: enforcing a cooldown between instant moves - so let's see how\nit works out in practice first.)",

It even synergizes with wands and a number of different god\npowers (it's 'non-attack damage' rather than 'spell damage' specifically),\nwhich I think could be interesting - dive into crowds to unleash Deal Four\nDestruction or Upheaval with more damage per piety than otherwise\npossible.)\n\n-----------------\n\nExposed status icon made by regret-index, using a CC0 weapon icon by Shade.",

      "message": "Replace Armataurs with Anemocentaurs\n\nArmataurs have had a very chequered design history, cycling through\nvarious names and different mechanical identities over the years. Several\nindividual gimmicks in the past were successful enough that they were\npulled out into other homes (eg: Vhi's and doubled potion heal), but\narmataurs themselves have always been unpopular (and are dead last in pick\nrate in recent versions). Many people have speculated that their flavour\njust doesn't resonate with people nearly so well as the centaurs they\noriginally replaced.\n\nAt the same time, armataur's current rollpage mechanic is also somewhat\ntroubled. Many characters struggle to get real value from it at all (in\npart because of the very non-linear nature of the bonus it gives per step\nversus how many steps a character can realistically take before being\nstuck in melee) and yet its synergy IMB is extreme, allowing for enormous\nregeneration and effectively unlimited MP in a multitude of scenarios.\nThis leads to a very 'polarized' experience for a core mechanic; an\narmataur that can use IMB and one that can't are practically different\nspecies (and the latter isn't a very impressive one).\n\nAnd yet the gameplay of wildly bouncing around like an invincible pinball\n*has* gotten a positive response from players (and AtCj, so this is an\nattempt to iterate on the spirit of that gameplay in a fashion that is\nboth better balanced and less narrow (ie: not reliant on a single spell),\nwhile at the same time overhauling the species flavour into something that\nplayers still express nostalgia for.\n\nAnemocentaurs are subspecies of centaurs that are distant descendants of\nthe Four Winds (based on the Anemoi of Greek myth, which were\nalternatingly depicted as either men or horses). They inherit armataurs'\nfocus on Rampage and go one further: if their last action was a rampage\nmove, they can continue to charge *into* enemies, pushing entire lines of\nthem backwards at once. This allows them to continue stampeding, even when\nsurrounded, without the need for specific spells to create distance (and\nin doing so, allows for novel tactics like charging forward to separate a\nsingle enemy from a crowd or push things back towards a safe area).\n\nLike armataurs, they also receive significant benefits from sustained\nrampaging to encourage them play more recklessly. However, exactly *what*\nbenefit they receive depends on a different unique mechanic. Leaning into\ntheir species flavour, each of the Four Winds provides a different\nrampage-related bonus to the player, and which wind is active depends on\nthe player's highest skill (as divided into four archetypes):\n -Melee (UC and melee weapon skills, except short blades)\n -Archer (ranged weapon skill)\n -Stabber (short blades or stealth skills)\n -Caster (all magic skills besides spellcasting)\n\nThis bonus (available starting from XL 5) adjusts dynamically as the player\ntrains skills, preventing the player from being locked into a single\narchetype as they gain levels and develop their character.\n\nIn terms of aptitudes, anemocentaurs are broadly similar to armataurs, but\nwith much better Air, Dodging, Ranged Weapons, and Invocations (reflecting\ntheir heritage), mildly better Translocations and Fighting, and less\noutstanding Armour (the juxtaposition of a armataur's +3 apt with Deformed\nBody was a little confusing for some players and anemocentaurs can more\neasily lean on the dodging side for defenses, despite their size).\n\nDetails and implementation for each of the four winds will follow in\nsubsequent commits.\n\n----------------------\n\nAnemocentaur base and form tiles were made by regret-index, using the human\nand armataur tiles of prior forms alongside Denzi's old monster and player\ncentaur tiles, jpeg's lich form centaur tile, and ontoclasm's edit of\nBloax's monster centaur tile. Stampede underlay made by Darby. Mutation\nicons combine that with a CC0 shield by SnoopethDuckDuck, Ontoclasm's old\nprotection ego and current penetration ego icons, and some tiny CC0 weapon\nicons by Shade.",

      "message": "Fix broken transparency on some player parts in local tiles\n\nBizarrely, player doll pieces were drawn front-to-back in local tiles. A\ncomment says this was so that ghost translucency would be handled better,\nbut also had the unavoidable effect that any pieces with translucent pixels\nwould be blended with the *floor* rather than what they were on top of. In\na few cases, this looked similar to carving a chunk out of the player\nholding them.\n\nPlayer ghosts still draw front-to-back as a fairly unsatisfying way to\ncomposite their parts together 'before' blending with the floor. This is\nstill incorrect when using any parts that are ordinarily translucent too,\nbut unlike players, I'm not sure they use any these ways (and to be honest,\nghost tile picking is very wierd anyway.)\n\nReally, this sort of thing should be done by drawing to an offscreen buffer\nfirst and then drawing to the screen, but I don't even want to contemplate\nwhat might be involved in getting Crawl's tile rendering code to actually\ndo that.",

Note also that this only\napplies to simple applications of damage and not cases where an unrand\ndirectly cast a spell (eg: Arc Blade).\n\n(At the same time, I refactored out the mondied argument of melee_effects\nsince it was already 100% determinable on melee_effects side anyway.

It turned out to be redundant with the way the\nsource's name was determined in the first place - which would result in\n'something' even when see_source was true, but the player couldn't actually\nsee it. (This was probably actually a good thing, since many places called\nit with a value of true even when the source was unseen, which would\notherwise be an information leak.)\n\nAlso, don't construct a scorefile entry every single time the player is\ninjured, just to check if a note *should* be taken about it. Instead only\ndo so if the player's HP is low enough (the default is 5%, so 'extremely\nrarely')",

In scarves case, these\nplusses were hidden but still functioned to give additional AC.\n\nPossibly randarts of these types should get some other perk when AC is\nunavailable (or simply be disallowed), but for now I am changing the\nnumbers a little so that they simply don't get anything (besides the bonus\npositive artprop budget that negative artprops always give).",

      "message": "Fix webtiles sidebar not always updating wielded item after letter swap\n\nIf the player swapped the letter of a wielded weapon with a letter\ncontaining a different item of the same non-artefact properties, webtiles\nwould consider them identical and not update its copy of the player's\ninventory. This meant that the sidebar would claim the player was wielding\na different weapon altogether (ie: what is now internally occupying that\ninventory slot, and NOT what they are actually wielding).\n\nRather than examine the full list of every item's artprops every time we\nsend the player, simply flag moved items as 'dirty' when remapping happens,\nwhich should avoid this problem.\n\nThis fixes #5075",

Though\nit is plausible the bugs from this are quite marginal (eg: get mesmerised\nby a siren while wielding the obsidian axe, have the siren fall down a\nshaft, take the axe off, run into the siren and get mesmerised by their\nown spell: fearing them no longer breaks it).\n\nBut fixing this might require a somewhat larger refactor (ie: storing\nforced/not-forced status in the beholder list itself), so I am leaving it\nalone for now.",

      "message": "Fix undefined behavior when killing a transiting bound soul via daction\n\nBinding a soul with Yred immediately kills any other bound soul the player\nmay have. This is done via daction, and if this daction is applied to a\ntransiting monster (ie: one not currently on any level, likely due to being\nbanished), several bad things can happen.\n\nSince monster inventories are stored as indicies into env.items on the\ncurrent floor, an in-transit monster that hasn't been placed yet will have\narbitrary items from the current floor appear to be in their inventory,\nwhich they will then try to drop on whatever coordinate they last left\nwhatever floor they were on. This might be inside a wall, causing other\nissues, and also means that any real items they were holding will be\npermanently lost.\n\nThe way Crawl handles both monster inventories and other floors makes this\na bit tricky to solve, so I have opted to instead give 1 aut of\nSLOWLY_DYING to a transiting bound soul instead. This should still kill it\nimmediately upon entering the floor it's transiting to, but at a time where\nits behavior is better-defined.\n\n(This entire scenario makes me worry that other dactions that can kill\ntransiting monsters may have other bugs, but this is the only one that can\ndrop items, so it's possible there isn't any *consequential* bugs with\nother dactions at the moment.)",

      "message": "Remove an assert that is reachable through a valid event sequence\n\nWhile it seems sensible to ensure that any monsters on the acting stack are\nvalid, it is possible for non-buggy scenarios to involve this not being the\ncase. A recent example involved a level excursion where a monster died\n(which adds it to the acting stack during its death code, then removes it\nafterward). The monster prior to it on the stack was back on the original\nfloor and thus inaccessible (thus the reference was to an invalid monster\nonly until the excursion ended).\n\nThis feels... dicey, since monsters on this stack are necessarily pointing\nat different monsters than they're 'supposed to' during an excursion, but\nI think the only consequence of this is ocassionally incorrect debug info\nin crash logs (and it should be very hard to hit the circumstances where\nthis is true). In any case, it feels better than rarely crashing through\nno fault of the player's.",

      "message": "Fix monster Portal Projectile not firing proper ranged attacks\n\nPortal Projectile was firing just the beam part of its ranged_attack_beam\nwithout the ranged_attack attached (because it bypassed fire() entirely).\n\nThe most obvious result of this was an assert when trying to drop a\nthrowing net that was shot this way, but launcher attacks done this way\nwere also using the default beam damage instead of performing an actual\nranged attack. This meant that (no matter what was being fired) they did\n10d10 damage with a to-hit of -1. This made it nearly impossible to\nactually hit anything, but if they *did*, they could do far more damage\nthan expected.\n\n(Using an external unwind_var like this is a bit ugly, but using fire()\nwith source=target causes some minor animation issues that I am not going\nto try adjusting during feature freeze.)",

This should result in the star knocking the monster back to\nthe position it was at at the start of its movement.",

But if an octopode was already constricting many things when\nthey changed gear in a way that lowered the number of things they could\nconstrict below what they were already constricting, they would then become\nable to constrict an unlimited number of things (since a negative number of\nusable tentacles will always be non-zero).\n\nNow you cannot cheat the limit this way.\n\n(I've not bothered with code to immediately unconstrict some number of\ntargets when swapping weapons in this way; it feels like too niche of a\nscenario to worry about.)",

      "message": "Don't pollute the lua C stack (DracoOmega)\n\nFor some reason, I never checked whether the error handler added in\n2b9214b6 was being removed by lua_pcall(). I assumed it just removed it\nlike how it removes the called function and its arguments. It turns out\nwe were polluting the lua C stack with an unremoved copy of this handler\nC function with almost *every* call to lua from C! This grew the stack\nso much that various weird issues could happen. In the case of the Disco\nPan vault, where lua is getting called a lot in every turn, the game\nwould start to lag more than it did in the past on that level. This was\nprobably the source of the mysterious objstat behaviour as well, but\nI'll have to investigate that further.\n\nThis commit removes the handler from position 1 of the stack after each\npcall. Debugging has shown that we're now entering functions like\nlua_element_colour_calc::get() each time with a C stack size of 0\ninstead one that can easily grow into the thousands. Movement through\nDisco Pan is significantly faster, although still laggy due to the\namount of lua calls happening.",

The code to pick the proper tile for a\nparchment would still think there was a parchment there, and then would\ntreat that corpse as if it were this parchment and often result in an\nassert (since both monster type and parchment spell were encoded as\nitem_def.plus and monster enums can greatly excede the valid range for\nspell enums). Unlike many such crashes, this one was possible on both local\ntiles and webtiles.",
