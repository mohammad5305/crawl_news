      "message": "Tweak some more recent monsters\n\n * Bes kemwar, while flatly increasing the previous threat of some early\n   D spawns by banding with them, and while also trying to be monsters\n   tutorializing their new gimmick more than anything else, could also\n   do with being more notable as threats in-and-of themselves rather than\n   solely serving as support. As such, they've gotten a higher cast rate\n   as well as slightly higher stats- still somewhat reserved as an early\n   D monster, but enough for their debuff to mean more than just resting\n   it off if they get unlucky with their bands.\n\n * Cognitogaunts and screaming refractions, while both reasonably\n   mechanically distinct Abyss monsters, are both somewhat rare in Abyss\n   and not super dangerous compared to the most dangerous Abyss spawns.\n   (The formers' Crypt appearances cutting from more harmless undead\n   doesn't also entirely override how they're a bit behind the curve\n   there.) I'm reluctant to flatly increase Abyss's overall threat level\n   considering a lot of it is baked into the overall branch structure,\n   so I'm just tweaking both of their spell rates up.\n\n * Death knights having turned out to be stand-out threats in V since\n   they got their new stats and spells in 76c8eab feels fine to me, as\n   their rare appearances also provide more notable encounters in V's\n   inherently-pressured lengthy floors, though I'd also prefer not to\n   push the threat level of V by too much. As a result, I've shifted\n   their scaling to be even less common on the first few floors of V (but\n   only mildly less common overall), resembling other top-tier V threats\n   like peacekeeper bands and sphinx bands. This comes with a very mild\n   reduction in glowing orange brain weight to compensate, which already\n   appear in enough branches as is.",

Their flash freeze isn't penetrating, refrigeration does very\nlittle to the zombies due to a combination of their cold resistance and\nthe huddling bonus (while the player is also benefitting from) and\nOstracism can't reach past things. It is fine for builds to be better or\nworse against given monsters, but it seems reasonable that they are *too*\nweak to this particular strategy.\n\nSo, in hopes to hit this most directly, without overly buffing them against\nother people, I am:\n -Reducing the huddle bonus that the player themselves benefits from.\n  Instead of taking 100/70/40% damage, the player now takes 100/85/70%\n  damage. This hopefully makes allies still a relevant and useful bonus,\n  but not in a way that can trivilize this.\n -Ostracism is now smite-targeted range 3 (but inflicts less ostracism per\n  cast). This is a minor buff for players already fighting them in melee,\n  while a nerf for those hiding behind other things.\n\nWe'll see how effective this ends up being.",

      "message": "Another pass at tweaking tesseract behavior\n\nWhile the original goal of not visually marking tesseract spawns (at least\nuntil the XP pool runs out and they become unrewarding) was to make them\nfeel like 'normal' wandering enemies and not draw unnecessary attention to\nthe fact that they had been created, in practice this seems to have had the\nopposite effect: instead of assuming tesseract spawns are normal monsters,\npeople assume that normal monsters are tesseract spawns, and often wildly\noverestimate the threat they pose as a consequence. By indicating them\nmore clearly, players may be able to form a more accurate intuition of\ntheir danger.\n\nAs such, several rules about tesseract spawns are simplified:\n -Spawns are never worth XP (though the tesseract itself is worth much\n  more), but they all provide normal on-kill benefits otherwise. The goal\n  of this is to avoid slow players eventually losing access to abilities\n  that may be vital to certain characters, such as Mahkleb's heal-on-kill\n  or Vehumet's mp-on-kill (which I always considered unfortunate in the\n  old system).\n -As such, *all* monsters made by tesseracts will disappear when they are\n  killed.\n -The spawn rate no longer changes over time, but remains a steady 1 per\n  ~50 turns. Instead, when first activated, a small number of new monsters\n  will be created immediately, somewhere *outside* the orb vault. (People\n  still mistakenly believed that spawns accellerated over time when the\n  reverse was true; this simplified version may be easier to communicate.)\n -Destroying a tesseract now additionally dazes all monsters in LoS range\n  of the tesseract for a ~9 turns. Some players suggested that an immediate\n  reward for aggression might make the forward pressure tesseracts applied\n  to them feel more equitable, and the hope here is that this can make it\n  a little safer to *be* aggressive while feeling like a fun and relevant\n  payoff (ie: a little more carrot and a little less stick)\n -The time at which tesseracts will start spawning monsters directly in the\n  player's LoS has been decreased (but few players should reach this point,\n  even now).\n\nI have made one subtler change in response to feedback from Acrobat\nregarding how making the orb guardians patrolling (but not the vault spawns\nthemselves) meant that it was sometimes still possible to use ?noise\nthrough the lung walls and wait a very long for maybe one or two things to\neventually stumble out (without bothering the orb guardians themselves).\nNow *all* monsters generated in the orb vault (whether placed by the vault\nor as random floor spawns) will be marked as patrolling until the tesseract\nis activated. This should have almost no practical effect on players not\nattempting to do the aforementioned strategy, but safely shut that\npossibility down.\n\n(Finally, I've actually added a note to the log when a tesseract is\nactivated; previously there was only a milestone, which was not visible in\nthe dump itself.)",

      "message": "Nerf protean grace\n\nWith the removal of berserkitis in 143df15, the dual reworks of inability\nto drink and read terminating in 1ae03d7 and c8003b0, and the nerf of\nteleportitis in 18b0d3c, the ceiling of bad mutations has been lowered a\nfair bit. When combined with the reduced permanent malmutation across the\ngame under the current strategic damage schema, as well as more good\nmutations just this version like Lucky (e722901), the expected value of\npotions of mutation has risen by a lot. I had added the Protean Grace\nmutation in a229ff6 as a valuable high-roll before such bad mutation\nreworks, but the numbers in practice can easily go quite high, and both\nmutation gods are far from weak at the moment, so I'd prefer to nudge this\nmutation back down.\n\nPreviously, the mutation had a soft cap of 7, where it'd halve the\nscaling of mutations to Slaying and EV to every other mutation. Now, it\napplies this halving at all times, and also rounds up by default: just\nhaving one or two mutations provides +1/+1, three or four provides +2/+2,\nand so on upwards. This should both be a little less kludgy with the\nabsence of an exact cap, and still get some benefit from having good\nand bad mutations alike, but still avoiding the extremely high benefits\nfor temporary whiles under Xom and Jiyva. It's a bit of a shame of a\nnerf, but potion of mutation gambling has become quite rewarding\ncurrently, and it's better than cutting out more possibilities entirely.",

And, in fact, even when the player\npossesses considerable stealth, that chance is still much higher each turn\nthan the chance of you screaming at them, despite the latter only being\nable to happen on a single turn. (In pratice, even with overwhelming\nstealth, this mutation is almost always less bad than remaining even one\nsingle extra turn in a monster's LoS).\n\nInstead, try differentiating it a little more from regular stealth checks\nby making it a chance to scream upon taking damage instead. (This is\ncurrently a 5/10% chance on sustaining damage, and the volume of the\nshouting is also increased slightly.)",

Thus we now flush the input buffer whenever a\nforced more occurrs, just in case (though not for any --mores-- caused by\nshow_more_message)\n\n(I wasn't able to reproduce this bug on Windows, very plausibly due to\ndifferent keyboard input handling - but it happens in both local tiles on\nLinux and webtiles, and probably elsewhere; I think it's probably quite\nold.)",

      "message": "Refactor to fix many issues with see_monster interrupts and messages\n\nThe \"Comes into view\" messages printed when monsters were first encountered\n(along with equipment warnings) were deeply entangled with activity\ninterrupts in a way that lead to multiple problems:\n -Situations where the player could not be interrupted would sometimes\n  suppress all such messages (eg: monsters first encountered upon entering\n  new floor would print no equipment warnings since stair travel is\n  uncancellable).\n -Situations that *might* be the first time a monster came into view\n  required special handling to avoid printing duplicate messages, which\n  itself was prone to bugs. For instance, if a monster the player had\n  not yet seen opened a door while the player was not in the middle of\n  delay, no message would be printed about the door opening at all.\n -Even in cases where the above worked, messaging was not always consistent\n  between 'monster did a thing' and 'monster you hadn't before seen did\n  that same thing' due to the latter occurring in a very different function\n  which lacked full context of the 'usual' message.\n -Certain special messages for encountering monsters (such as monsters in\n  the Abyss appearing in sight of the player) would often not be used\n  unless the player was performing a delay at the time.\n\nThere was also a great deal of duplicated code to handle printing these\n'comes into view' messages depending on their timing (which also resulted\nin duplicated code for handling Shoutitis, Gozag Incite, and Attractitis),\nalong with message-handling for many long-removed things like monsters\nunsubmerging, being freshly spawned from adjacent floors via stairs, or\neven unbreathing monsters walking out of deep water again.\n\nTo top this off, due to relying on see_monster interrupts to notice\neligible monsters, Shoutitis (including maw form), Gozag Incite (and\nAttractitis, were it enabled) could be turned off by user option - monsters\nincluded in runrest_ignore_monster will never produce interrupts or comes\ninto view messages, thus never triggering these effects! Madness.\n\nBeyond this, see_monster interrupts themselves functioned in ways that\noften caught players by surprise. Because they could only be fired for\nmonsters the player has *never* seen before, a common scenario involved\nfleeing from a dangerous monster, much later starting to change armour with\nno monster in sight, and then having that same monster walk back into\nsight, spend several turns approaching the player with no notification\nuntil they clobbered them in the head. When this happened with something\nlike an early ogre, it could be directly fatal.\n\nThis commit makes many structural changes to improve this situation:\n -see_monster interrupts can now be fired for previously-encountered\n  monsters, so long as they were not in sight when a delay was started.\n -Messaging for normal monster actions no longer depends on interrupt\n  messages in any scenario, untangling \"monster did a thing\" and \"you first\n  noticed a monster\" entirely.\n  -In cases where a previously-encountered monster triggers an interrupt,\n   a shorter message will be displayed so that the player knows what caused\n   it.\n -\"X comes into view.\" is replaced with \"You encounter X.\", which removes\n  much of the need to control message ordering so strictly to ensure it is\n  printed first in all scenarios (which was a regular source of bugs), as\n  well as potentially being more intuitive to newcomers (after all,\n  monsters come into view all the time without getting that message!)\n -Encountering a single monster and encountering multiple monsters at once\n  now share the same encounter message code.\n -Shoutitis, attractitis, and Gozag wrath no longer depend on interrupts,\n  but merely encountering a new monster.\n -Many unused messages are removed (and a few have their wording improved).\n -Command repetition no longer ignores the presence of monsters if they\n  came into view on the first turn of repetition.\n -Abyss monsters now consistently produce special messages when created in\n  sight of the player (and their band members now also do so, as well as\n  properly producing translocation clouds).\n  -Using the same technique, monsters spawned in sight of the player on the\n   orb run now say something more than just 'X comes into view'.\n -Monsters previously sensed by monster detection can now interrupt travel\n  again if the player actually leaves the floor (it was harder to think of\n  a better metric for this).\n -Probably a handful of more minor things I have forgotten.",

(One of the more common\nscenarios involves Xom summons or god wrath.)\n\nLooking through git history, this (duration > 1) check was originally put\nin with the reasoning that choosing to cancel on the final turn still\nconsumed time for no benefit anyway. However, this does not seem to be the\ncase in modern Crawl and does allow the player to cancel a turn earlier\nthan they othewise would (possibly this changed the last time delays were\nsignificantly refactored ~9 years ago?)",

      "message": "Reduce potion/scroll hoarding to one level, and restrict to Ru sacs\n\nWhile these mutations may have lacked the dissatisfying RNG of the previous\n-potion/scroll mutations, reaction to them in practice was mixed, with many\npeople finding them *more* oppressive than the old ones to recieve as\nrandom malmuts and generally a bit unfun. There was particular concern with\nthis regarding Xom, where a player might end up restricted in this way for\nquite a while.\n\nHowever, players still seemed to consider them better-designed than the\nprevious mutations in this role as a Ru sacrifice, so I have restricted\nthem to this role, reducing them from 2 levels to 1 (and setting the\nrestriction of each at 50% HP). It's still a little unclear to me if their\npiety gain should be adjusted - even experienced players seemed divided on\nthe subject.\n\n(I have also reflavoured them a little to fit Ru's theme better, now that\nthey are Ru-exclusive again.)",

      "message": "Rework teleportitis somewhat (regret-index)\n\nSeveral times in past, the idea was floated to make the teleportitis\nmutation work closer to sojourning bolt (ie: warning the player in advance,\nand allowing them to spend teleport scrolls to avoid it when crucial). The\nhope was that this might feel a little less backbreaking and a bit more\nagentive on players parts.\n\nThe way teleportitis (and hostile teleport in general) previously worked is\nthat it would repeatedly attempt a fully random teleport, and then reroll\nthe destination if there weren't monsters in sight. This usually failed\nsilently, but at a rate that had a complex relationship with how many\nmonsters were on a floor and how open it was. For instance, the chance of\nteleportitis succeeding when called on an uncleared early D floor was ~30%,\npotentially dipping to ~10% when the floor was nearly empty (but could be\nas high as ~80% on V:5!).\n\nGetting teleported to monsters is *already* more dangerous in places full\nof monsters (like V:5), even if it happened at the same rate there as\nelsewhere, rather than several times higher.\n\nThe new method (using code from wyrmholes) is guaranteed to teleport the\nplayer into sight of *some* monster, if there are any. I have set the\ntrigger rate vaguely approximating the 'average' prior chance, plus a\nlittle bit more to account for being able to cancel the scariest teleports\nin advance. (I have also given it an internal cooldown to avoid feelsbad\nsituations with using ?tele only to immediately start teleporting anyway).\n\nA few other things relied on the same 'usually fails' hostile teleport\ncode: Lugonu wrath, distortion unwield, and explore traps. The first two\nwill now always work, while the latter is given a 70% fail rate to\napproximate how common it is now. (Fun fact: you'd get a message for Ash\npreventing teleport traps that would never have triggered in the first\nplace, giving an inflated sense of how helpful this trap protection was!)",
