      "message": "Completely rewrite default target picking and cycling code\n\nThe code which rested at the core of direction_picker and controlled how\ndefault targets were picked for spells was ancient and deeply arcane,\nmaking it laborious to make even simple, oft-requested QoL improvements to\nmany spells. It also suffered from multiple surface-level issues, like\ninconsistent behavior about aiming explosions to avoid the player hitting\nthemselves. (eg: casting fireball with a single enemy in melee range of you\nwould aim off to the side of that enemy, so as to avoid getting caught in\nthe blast, only if you had not previously aimed at that enemy on a prior\nturn. If you *had*, it would instead aim straight at them and force the\nplayer to adjust the aim or deal with a warning prompt.)\n\nThis commit replaces the inner workings of this part of direction_chooser\nentirely and improves a multitude of autotargeting behaviors in the\nprocess. It no longer uses recursion with multiple gotos or targets enemies\nbased on viewport dimensions(!) and should be vastly easier to work with in\nfuture. In addition:\n\n -AoE will be noticably better at avoiding the player, regardless of\n  whether you'd previously aimed at that enemy.\n -AoE will also attempt to avoid harming allies, if a trivial aim\n  adjustment could accomplish this.\n -The aimer is more aware of when AoE is harmless to the player, and won't\n  needlessly aim-adjust a wand of roots off to the side of an enemy.\n -You no longer need to aim directly at a monster for the aimer to consider\n  it your 'previous target'; merely catching it in the blast of a spell is\n  sufficient. (In cases where multiple monsters are in the affected area,\n  it will prioritize keeping its existing target lock, and otherwise pick\n  the closest to the centre.)\n -+/- can now cycle through enemies that aren't themselves in range, but\n  could be hit by AoE (ie: enemies just beyond the range of fireball) and\n  will work sensibly with LRD.\n -Ranged autofight will more consistently use smart default aim, instead of\n  only doing so for some spells.\n -Previous monster target is saved via mid instead of mindex (which could\n  rarely do weird things when mindexes were reused)\n -Better default behavor for some spells like Gavotte (no longer\n  prioritizes aiming at nearby enemies) or Tempering (prefers constructs\n  with enemies actually in the blast zone.)\n\nAll in all, this should produce meaningfully improved behavior for a number\nof spells (and AoE spells like fireball, in particular, should prompt the\nplayer about harming self or allies *significantly* less, making them more\nautofight-friendly.)\n\nTo be clear, this isn't an attempt to make targeting smarter in the sense\nof 'make better decisions for the player'. It doesn't attempt to choose\nmore important enemies or maximize how many things are caught in AoE, but\nrather to not present the player with 'obviously incorrect' default aims.\nIt will still generally prioritize 'last-targeted enemy' or 'closest\nenemy', but not default to including the player's face in the blast when\nsome obvious way not to do that exist. (And all of this new behavior is\ndisabled if Options.simple_targeting is true, though using that feels\npersonally quite questionable to me.)\n\nThis commit also removes a couple unused or non-functional commands (some\neffectively broken since as far back as 553c0cd8d1dc9edb71fdb08f1d3d3be3 ),\nas well as CMD_TARGET_PREV_TARGET (which I feel was largely opaque and\nunhelpful). Finally, while 'iterate through feature in viewport while\naiming' has been reimplemented for the sake of using stairs via x, you\ncan no longer cycle through items on the ground with ;/' in that mode. I am\nunconvinced that this was ever useful to do when ctrl+x exists (and X still\noffers the same functionality for the map in general.). +/- still works for\ncycling objects when aiming Apportation.\n\nAll in all, I hope this is a significant improvement to code readability,\nand also a meaningful improvement to player QoL with many different spells.\n\nDeath to _find_square.",

But the real problem is not\nplayer illusions, but Mara themselves, so refactor things to hide the\nsummoner specifically if it's Mara, but show it for other player illusion\nsources (ie: mainly the strange machines in the Tukima wizlab)\n\nThis fixes #4083",

      "message": "Refactor god_protects, shoot_through_monster, and related functions\n\nA number of different types of ally are intended to either never be harmed\nby player actions, or outright be fired through (eg: battlespheres, Hep\nancestors, demonic guardians). But many of these different catergories are\nhandled by different functions, and one category or another being\noverlooked from some attack is a frequent source of bugs.\n\nThis refactors essentially all such cases to go through a pair of\nfunctions: never_harm_monster() and shoot_through_monster(). The former is\nfor all monsters that should never be negatively affected by any actions\ncaused the a given agent (usually the player). shoot_through_monster() is\nmostly the exact same list, except additionally includes Jiyva jellies\n(where the player cannot harm them, but also cannot shoot through them.)\n\n(I think some of this Jiyva behavior is a bit strange and incorrect, but\nI've not attempt to change its current functionality in this commit.)\n\nnever_harm_monster() shoud be used in most cases, with\nshoot_through_monster() specifically for projectiles.\n\nThis commit also fixes a handful of existing bugs, such as it being\npossible to affect a demonic guardian with Irradiate or slow any\nnormally-unharmable ally with Metabolic Englaciate.\n\nThis also fixes #3985, and half of #4083",

It felt that\nit was fine if the player *couldn't* instantly dismiss them (and largely\nstill do), but this is aimed at improving QoL for clockwork bee in\nparticular.\n\nWhen there are no more targets around to attack, clockwork bee falls\ndormant. It also cannot be recharged without a visible target. This\nfrequently results in it briefly blocking a corridor after a battle, and\nwhile I have not *personally* felt that this is a problem (you should\nrest!), enough other people have found it annoying that I am doing this\nwith the aim of making it feel better for them.\n\nThis solution still feels 'clunky' to me (needing an additional command and\ngiving a *much* longer message when trying to reactivate a bee without a\ntarget), but other proposed solutions have had potentially more serious\nside-effects, so let's just give this a try for now and see what player\nresponse is.",

      "message": "New monsters: alderkings, death trees for Depths and rarely Crypt\n\nWhile plants have been very slowly added to Crawl due to the innate\ndifficulties of designing more immobile monsters, the motile plant glyph\n('f') is one of the few console glyphs mostly wide open for additional\nmonsters. There's a lot of easy flavourful design space for more plants,\nand in particular, adding one of them in Depths has multiple benefits: it\ncan connect the various spriggans moved there closer to a branch otherwise\nmostly preoccupied with giants and undead, it can make Fedhas's plant\npacification mean a little more throughout the game, and it can help\nfurther split apart the artificial fortification spirit of the Vaults\nversus the more uncontrolled cavern-dungeon of the Depths.\n\nAlderkings are a translated name of something from various works of\nGermanic literature, a storied figure of a darkwood elf king that haunts\ndeep forests and absconds with or kills trespassers. (Crawl's elves aren't\nparticularly fey, so it's deployed around the main fey threats of\nspriggans instead. The translation drift between the Danish elverkonge and\nGerman erlkönig is a couple centuries old, so it feels fine to make it\nliterally a tree as the artistic tradition still includes rather than some\nfey spirit. Without a name to the title and with a lot of differing takes\nin centuries of tradition, demoting them to a non-unique feels fine enough\nto me.) These are deep out-of-depth walking trees in Depths with\nmildly-below-ettin level melee damage, reasonable hp and AC but poor EV and\nrF-, plus three notable spells:\n\n * Grasping Roots, the ranged constriction spell used by shambling\n   mangroves: aside from using a little more constriction in Depths as is\n   less present in Vaults with tentacled monstrosities moved out from the\n   branch, it also slows running away from its short-range other spells.\n\n * Siphon Essence, the range-2 torment into self-healing ability\n   provided by talismans of death: an experiment in trying out more\n   highly dangerous short-range spells and means of healing monsters in a\n   more reasonably tangible fashion, a means of endangering lategame\n   characters with very high defenses, and a chance to establish yet\n   another unique way to deal unholy damage as Crawl's large focus on\n   unholy threats regularly needs. Unlike Torment, this range can be\n   avoided for a large number of characters, and it also can avoid\n   hurting living allies as Depths still contains plenty of.\n\n * Dispel Undead, the not-ranged version players, their ghosts, and\n   burial acolytes use: a chance to further emphasize that monsters can\n   have varying Dispel Undead ranges, and one short enough to still\n   emphasize their Grasping Roots.\n\nThus, they pin their foes in place, cast high-damage short-range spells\nwith various non-standard resistance checks, and then finish them off\nwith heavy melee. Hopefully the obvious synergies between these spells and\nthe rarity of a character caring about both Siphon Essence and Dispel\nUndead will be straightforward enough for players to learn and fear.\nThey're quite scary in practice, but Depths threatens a lot with large\nbands of monsters; they'll mostly endanger reckless spell-less characters,\nwho would be just as imperilled if not more so by shrike and spark wasp\nbands. One can always teleport before they get close, after all....\n\nAside from placing around once or twice per game in generic threat vaults\nand regular floor spawns, they also appear in a number of forested,\nnecromantic, and magical vaults throughout Depths. As strong necromantic\ncasters, these also appear in a sparse Crypt vaults that already used dead\ntrees; since the branch has plenty of regular living necromancers already,\nthis shouldn't be too out of place. (This also comes with some tweaking of\nvarious other uses of dead trees and petrified trees, to deal with the\nautomagic feature-recolouring-to-tile match-up mess.)\n\nTheir tile is an amalgamation of CanOfWorms's hill giant, Sastreii's\ndemonic trees, roctavian's shambling mangrove, and ontoclasm plus\nlingerstink's Asterion. It animates in a mildly experimental fashion to\nbridge tree foilage and necromancy colours.",

Since then, Swamp has gotten quite a ways more\ndangerous, and in particular druids can call in bunyips in Swamp or\nshrikes and spark wasps in Depths. As such, I'm removing this one special\ncase, letting them care about the other types of dragon when calling in\nor granting might to beasts in general.",

This enstates their proper chance to appear in\n   a band versus depth, while adjusting the numbers to make them appear\n   quite often with lindwurms, more rarely with slime creatures, and with\n   less beasts overall in their more common vaults.\n\n * Arcanists were added on the same console glyph and colour combination\n   in 129f0b0 since the ironbound beastmaster removal. I'm moving\n   arcanists over to lightred, since it matches their tile and what\n   currently is on that same combination (the true form of shapeshifters)\n   is harmless whenever actually found anyway.\n\n * Their description has been tweaked to not raise confusion about them\n   causing frenzy or berserk with their aura.",

At one point in time, 'Fire' was sufficient to\n imply rF+/rC-/fire-enhancer, but that is no longer the case. (ie: when\n 'Fire' shows up on a randart staff or orb, it may *only* mean a fire\n enhancer, with no resists baked in.)\n\nThis closes #2664",

      "message": "Refactor how tile-picking for beams works\n\nTile selection for beams used to be handled by tileidx_bolt(), which was\norganized in an... archaic manner. Tile selection was done via a\ncombination of beam color and string-matching against the name of the\nprojectile being fired. This was clunky and also error-prone in several\nways: projectile text could be edited elsewhere (which would silently cause\ntheir custom tiles to disappear), tile overrides for removed spells could\nremain long after the spell was gone (since it's not obvious which string\ncorresponds to what spell). In fact, both of those things were true for at\nleast one or two spells immediately prior to this commit!\n\nThis removes that function entirely and instead allows any custom tiles to\nbe specified as a simple member of zap_info (or manually-specified via\nbeam.tile_beam and beam.tile_explosion, in cases where zaps are not used.)\nIf neither is specified, it will still fall back on the default\ncolor-to-tile mapping done by tileidx_zap().\n\nThis also allows the tile for the path of a beam, and the explosion at the\n*end* of that beam, to use different tiles easily. This has been applied to\niceblast (and related spells) and fireball at present, but could easily be\nextended to move things. (I think it is a cleaner visual, in general, if\nthe non-damaging trail and damaging explosion of an effect use different\ntiles, though not all effects have such obviously useful tiles\npre-existing.)\n\nTile directional orientation is now also handled automatically by\nvary_bolt_tile() and I renamed the tile enums for the 'default' color-based\nbolts to be clearer.\n\nAside from the aforementioned animation tweaks to iceblast/fireball, there\nshould be no other functional change.",

      "message": "Adjust Rimeblight spread mechanics\n\nWhile a powerful spell in the right circumstances (and with appropriately\ngrisly flavour), rimeblight could be more inconsistant than one would like.\nWhile the spread chance from explosions was quite high, it was never\nguaranteed, and poor early rolls could fail to get the plague going in a\nmeaningful way, making it sometimes feel like a poor use of turns. Delayed\ndamage always has an uphill fight to compete against burst damage, and the\nwhiffs felt just a bit too common.\n\nAlso, while there was a chance to spread upon death, the fact that a living\ninfected had many *more* chances to spread rimeblight (via explosions)\ncould make it feel bad to have them die early. A level 7 spell ideally\nshouldn't make you feel bad if it kills something, so I have changed the\nspread mechanics in the hope to make it both more consistent and never\n'punish' you for killing an infected monster early.\n\nRimeblight now has the same 'chain-to-adjacent-enemies-on-cast' behavior\nthat Petrify does, afflicting up to two connected enemies per cast. The\nice shard explosion no longer spread rimeblight at all, but upon death, it\nhas a 100% chance to spread to adjacent enemies, and a 50% chance to spread\nto those at radius 2. Combined, these should make it easier to get started,\nless likely to abruptly peter out due to RNG, and if anything *reward*\nkilling things quickly with undead or refridge assistance to spread it\nfurther.",

      "message": "Replace Darts of Dispersal with Darts of Disjunction\n\nDarts of dispersal were most noticable as part of Warpers' starting kit,\nbut despite multiple buffs, were still largely a 'desperation option' you\nwere never happy to use.\n\nWarper's biggest weakness is that none of its kit provides it any offensive\npower whatsoever until it can cast Piledriver (which is at least XL 3, and\nusually later) Back when their darts were boomerangs instead, sometimes the\ndamage *could* make a difference in early fights, but now they are more\nakin to a blink that can miss (but costs no MP) and blinking is something\nwarpers are generally not lacking for! And since dispersal darts aren't\nreally relevant to anyone else when they can (rarely) show up later in the\ngame, let's just try replacing their effect entirely.\n\nDisjunction darts inflict a short-lived status effect on enemies they hit\nwhich causes them to blink a short distance away from the thrower for 3-4\nturns in a row, taking 2d2 damage each time they do so. This still allows\nthem to be used as an escape option (perhaps even more reliably than\npresent), but the small flat damage very specifically is aimed at helping\nwin fights in those first couple XLs.\n\nThey also do not auto-mulch, like dispersal used to, but mulch at the\nstandard rate for dats. (I feel this behavior was somewhat of a holdover\nfrom when it could show up on proper ammo that did *real* damage. There's\na big difference between doing a whole battle's worth of normal attacks\nthat keep a target displaced versus the ocassional dose of minor damage.)\n\nI did not remove the Dispersal missile brand entirely in this commit (it\nmight be possible it finds another home on something in future?), but it no\nlonger naturally spawns on anything. Outside of a sprint, all places that\nused dispersal darts now use disjunction ones instead.",

      "message": "Make Piledriver's targeting more flexible\n\nWhile Piledriver's damage can be significant when the spell is first\nlearned, there are a number of things about the spell that make it awkward\nto use in a number of situations - one of which is how groups of enemies\nwill tend to file into a neat line behind each other while the player is\nrepositioning to line up a shot, rending the spell literally unusable on\nany of them.\n\nNow, multiple contiguous enemies in a row can be pushed together, dealing\ndamage to whichever enemy is at the *back* of that line. This should\nhopefully allow the spell to feel like it 'misses' less often.\n\n(Regardless of the length of this line of monsters, they must still move at\nleast 1 tile and strike something which is in LoS of the caster, which\nactually fixes a preexisting bug that allowed kobolds to sometimes query\nfor presence of walls or creatures out of their LoS.)\n\nAdditionally, this commit allows the player to pick which of multiple valid\npiledriver directions they want to move along. I'd originally hoped that\nthe auto-targeting would create interesting positional decisions, and while\nI believe that it does to an extent, it is common to end up with coinflips\nbetween 'good move' and 'extremely bad move'. I don't think these feel very\nsatisfying and can make it feel punishing to try utilising the spell as a\ncore part of your kit sometimes. \"I would have been better off casting\nnothing and just running away.\" is not a great feel and happens somewhat\ncommonly at the moment.\n\nThe spell still does dramatically more damage when pushing things a long\ndistance, so I am hoping that alone is sufficient to create interesting\npositional questions and encourage some aggression (rather than only using\nit along 'safer' trajectories). We'll see.",

      "message": "Heavily revise and revive ironbound beastmasters\n\nV is a branch that is very pressured in its placement- usually immediately\nafter some of the higher variety in the game in the Lair branches, usually\nbefore the heavy large vault use in Elf and Depths that it itself can\nbarely use, and yet not originally given a unique monster set to itself.\nThere's been multiple attempts to help out the branch out with more and\nmore unique monsters, and in my personal opinion, it could always use\nmore: the loose theme of much more organized and cosmopolitan structure\nis easily workable, and V:1-4 has decent value as a pacing break after the\nfirst few runes that still tries to stand out mechanically.\n\nIronbound beastmasters were tried out in 0b001ba and removed in f8b08d3\nfor a number of reasons that are each reasonably addressable in different\nfashions:\n\n * Depending solely on their bands made them require unique and very\n   frail special-casing to always place their band regardless of other\n   calls for individual monsters (in vaults, wizmode placements, bot\n   information calls, and so on). Rather than going out of the way to make\n   sure individual beastmaster spawns come with a band, they instead now\n   only spawn a part of V animal and slime bands when those bands already\n   successfully place, with a chance increasing by depth to join lindwurm,\n   slime creature, and dire elephant bands when the full band spawns\n   already. (This replaces one of the dire elephants with a beastmaster\n   when it spawns, but doesn't for lindwurms or slime creatures.)\n\n * Goad Beasts was a very invisible spell, since the actual number of\n   actions monsters take in a turn without involving spells is a\n   relatively subtle effect. Instead of relying on the energy system, this\n   instead relies on a far more direct effect using other reworked\n   systems: they simply have an passive aura of haste for living\n   creatures of animal or lower intelligence. This should also help\n   create very little ambiguity as to what they haste, because they\n   visibly immediately haste or don't haste given other monsters.\n\n * They were also pretty weak for their depth when caught by themselves\n   seperated from a successful band placement, whether from bands\n   wandering around or being convoked. This return comes with somewhat\n   higher base damage and a coinflip chance for a polearm. They also now\n   have a new support spell that can work with other monsters than beasts\n   or slimes, \"Throw Bolas\", which does relatively minor physical damage\n   for the depth and also inflicts -Move. (The rope for the bolas\n   projectile and spell icon is a CC0 asset by fleurman, and the balls are\n   steel sling bullet icons by ontoclasm.)\n\n(To accomodate the last of these, paralysis and petrification both end\nwith \"You can now act again\", and -Move from Momentum Strike now reads\n\"You can move again\" rather than \"You are no longer robbed of your\nmomentum\".)\n\nI'll let players find out in practice just how common it is to be bound in\nplace as hasted dire elephants or hasted titanic slime creatures barrel\ntowards them. Players are pretty strong by the time they do V, and I'm\ndoubtful the ~4 beastmasters per visit will noticeably more dangerous than\nthe multitudes of thunderhulks or convokers, anyway. Being interrupted\nheavily by not being able to move may get some resistance from players who\notherwise focus solely on playing quickly (c.f. 98a3e4f and 54e5184), but\nfortunately their boosted allies can help solve the problem of reckless\nplay in a quick and direct fashion.",

Polterguardians\nhave been rejected for being too weak in impact, and I'm taking out\nservants of whispers in the same capacity. Since these lists are getting\nexceptionally long and messy, I've adjusted the lines here to use only\none of a given monster per floor- this hopefully will be more specifically\nmemorable to use a floor of curse skulls support, ot a floor of moth of\nwrath support, rather than intermingling every floor getting the vault with\na dozen or more different enemies from the one custom list. Finally, I\nmoved undying armouries out of the summons list- Flashing Balestra doesn't\nwork through grates- and over into the suppressors list now renamed a\nsupport list.\n\nMerges and closes #4109.]",

      "message": "Give Dispater AF_CORRODE\n\nMultiple fronts of reasons for this, really:\n\n * Dis has a corrosion mechanic presented simply for being inside it, but\n   only caustic shrikes further the flavour or mechanical connection\n   between the location of the hells' iron city and said corrosion effect\n   (versus how many different ways earth and metal themes are used on\n   monsters across the game and in Dis itself). While the other floors of\n   Dis are plenty dangerous as is, Dispater themself has the lowest\n   killratio of any of the hell lords in the past three versions, and thus\n   can take a buff.\n\n * Compared to the unrand Pan lords, who have lots of unique or nearly\n   unique spells to be flashy and memorable encounters, the hell lords are\n   rather straightforward and boring in various different capacities.\n   The hells themselves may be fairly more dangerous, but surely the\n   uniques guaranteed each extended rune should get a little more to them\n   too? Antaeus is easily kited, Ereshkigal has so many spells she's too\n   inconsistent at actually following up silence or paralysis, and\n   Asmodeus and Dispater are extremely similiar uniques with elemental\n   projectile spells + Hurl Damnation + limited demon summon options, high\n   AC and low EV, and a fixed equipment drop. (Asmodeus is statistically\n   more dangerous due to Fire Summon getting to summon more at once, of\n   course.) AF_CORRODE's irresistable corrosive nature as is deployed only\n   on rust devils otherwise somewhat adds to the threat possibility space\n   (I expect a bunch of good death logs with Corr (-40) before enough\n   people pay enough attention) in a reasonably thematic enough fashion to\n   work with.",

Looking up 'fire' returns an incredible number\nof results (most of which aren't fire.) This is an often-requested feature\nin one form or another, so here's a stab at something simple and hopefully\nhelpful.\n\nIf you type '@', followed by a part of that school name, into spell search,\nit will now return all player book spells of that school and nothing else.\n(ie: '@necro' returns all player necromancy book spells.)

      "message": "Add a preview for examined equipments' effect on spell success\n\nEquipment in Crawl has a signficant effect on spell success that can often\nbe difficult to intuitively predict the magnitude of. The general advice\nfor determining just how badly that heavy armour will affect your spells is\nto try it on, but this isn't always possible. Sometimes a player is\nconsidering buying expensive armour from a shop, but isn't sure if it will\nruin their important spells or not. Worse, Ashenzari worshippers often\ncannot swap their items without literally destroying them forever.\n\nIn the spirit of items showing preview of how they would modify your EV,\nitem descriptions now indicate their effect on spell success. Since effect\non spell success is extremely individual to the spell, a single number\ncannot be provided; instead, a second page of information is provided for\nitems that would modify spell success rate (accessible by pressing '!')\n\nThis indicates the change in spell failure for every spell the player knows\nwhich would change by at least 1%. They are sorted in order of magnitude of\nchange, and color-coded for how good/bad the change is. Items which cause\nany such change mention this in the same space where AC/EV changes are\nlisted (along with how to access the additional information).\n\nSomething like this has been a repeatedly-requested feature for some time\nnow. I hope it will be helpful!",

      "message": "More specific spell icon / effect tiles\n\nMost of these are using the new flash_tile() functionality added for\nvarious Forgecraft spells to add new flashes of debuffs that are extremely\nimportant to not miss, dramatizing them more than other debuffs and\nhopefully continuing to make it harder to miss that they were inflicted.\n(Several of these didn't even _have_ visual effects previously, which was\nespecially strange considering most hexes do by default.) The\nsplinterfrost barricade salvo, meanwhile, is meant to help distinguish it\nfrom using the non-penetrating Throw Icicle effect.\n\nSources:\n\n * Draining Gaze vfx: roctavian's edit of Denzi's eye of draining.\n * Doom Howl vfx: roctavian's Shadow Fiend tile.\n * Entropic Weave vfx: Denzi's burst graphics and Pete Hurst's cobwebs.\n * Sap Magic vfx: snw-0's icon for the Sap Magic invocation +\n                  Sastreii's antimagic icon.\n * Sentinel's Mark vfx: aidan holm's Sentinel's Mark spell icon.\n * Splinterfrost salvos: An edit of roctavian's throw icicle projectiles.\n * Stoke Flames icon: pianoman523's current creeping inferno tile.\n\nThis also comes with some reorganizing of dc-misc.txt to sort the spell\neffects by rough school of origin, to ease any further additions to the\nfile.",
