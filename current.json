      "message": "More adjustments for some recently-changed late uniques\n\n * Norris's killratio is doing quite poorly since his return, in some part\n   due to trying to avoid the same Paralysis that was seen as redundant in\n   his original removal but also not successfully getting AF_SLEEP due to\n   potential multiplier one-shot spikiness. He went from a resistable Drain\n   Magic to an irresistable but proportional mp drain in d00db9e cutting\n   out Brain Feed for Brain Bite, and that's another distinguishing aspect\n   we can keep working with when he's already intersecting a little with\n   other water themed monsters as is, so I'm pushing his antimagic\n   component even further by replacing Brain Bite for Draining Gaze's\n   extremely dramatic 0-30 mp range. More focusing on destructive magic is\n   definitely less time spent on peace and contemplation of death, and it\n   emphasizes a threat distinct from most late uniques.\n\n   (This also comes with a somewhat silly tile for Draining Gaze and new\n   messages + some resorting within monspell.txt.)\n\n * Frederick is missing the fighter tag, despite having been buffed to\n   deal more melee damage than several other uniques in the same range with\n   conjurations also (Norris, Jory, Sojobo). He's been doing decently after\n   the 0.31 release and the tweaks of b247575 / b730325 / 1baa85e, so I'm\n   nudging his damage down slightly (50 -> 44) in exchange for a little\n   consistency with surrounding uniques in getting an accuracy improvement.\n\n * Boris can use equipment while regular liches can't, for whatever reason,\n   and always spawns with a robe. As a little more of an incentive to\n   actually kill him rather than park him on a floor, and to give more\n   distinction between attempts beyond the orb run or the luck of other\n   spawns, I'm giving him a randart robe every time he spawns, guaranteed\n   to be at least +2. He spawns quite late, so it's rare for people to want\n   to switch over to a robe if they didn't have a decent extremely light\n   body armour already, but it lets e.g. casters refight Boris repeatedly\n   to find Archmagi (and then possibly die to orbs and misery).",

      "message": "Part one of megazig buffing - scale them faster\n\nThe first ziggurat in each game is in a good place. Even three-rune\ncharacters can dip into the first few floors for reasonable rewards\ncompared to Depths itself, while extended characters can try their luck\neven without L8/L9 conjuration spells for reasonably further.\n\nMegazigging, unsurprisingly, has been strangely affected by spells, gods,\nand items over the years since 62fe6c3. While megazig design shouldn't\ntake any priority over the rest of Crawl, it's clear that most floors fall\nto Gozag, Ignition, orbs of mayhem, Powered by Death or Djinn HP, talismans\nof death, and the occasional fallback of autopenetrating javelins to the\npoint of a certain tedium. Only Silence, Sap Magic, and the occasional\nhundred Seraphs manage to roll much of any chance to kill the player. While\nI wanted to provide some variety with minimal effort or codebase burden for\na niche group of zig delvers, it is clear that most of the raw numbers of\nmegazigs don't really threaten without luck considering the 100 or 200 zigs\nresults the top delvers have. They can play older versions if they want to\ngrind raw numbers, but for future versions, I'd like to even out this\ndifficulty across floors some more and make the practice somewhat more of\nan accomplishment overall by making zigs past the first all fairly more\nlethal.\n\nThe first step of several planned steps for megazig buffing is to ramp up\nthe current scaling. Zig completion's effects on monster choices is tripled\nin most cases and doubled on monster placing in floors. Floors won't always\nmax out before hitting double-digits (due to increasing HD inherent to\nthose monster choices), but around Zig 9 they usually can, and this also\nemphasizes the danger of several other sets before one can completely max\nout elemental skills or reliably have all of the unrands to work with.\nThe floors with silent spectres, pan lords, or ghosts all don't scale those\nmonsters quite as fast as the others, though.\n\n(Also, slip in some buffs to a few loose floors. Of particular note:\nquicksilver elementals for dispelling haste are now emphasized monsters in\nDis and Vestibule sets, draconian stormcallers and scorchers are emphasized\nin draconian sets to rain down Upheaval + damnation, and Pan floors now\nscale to emphasize just tier-1s and demonspawn.)",

      "message": "First fresh vault review for 0.32\n\nThe usual scaling sets much more versus depth, reducing long tails of\nabsurd rolls for monsters, cleaning up headers to fit a more consistent\nhouse style, so on and so forth. One particular point that'll fit into\nthese recurring vault reviews from hereon is that with more decorative\nfeatures added and to be added, early crystal appearances and granite\nstatue counts will be regularly reduced to compensate- there's far too many\nuses of such in early D for them to stand out as decorative any more or for\nit to stand out in dangerous vaults past the earlygame, which can do with\nsome trimming down in exchange for some of these fancier options.\n\nA few other things of note:\n\n * Some hells ambushes have been nerfed a little, with added cover and\n   slightly lower monster counts. While extended can and should be quite\n   cruel to players, there's a big difference between even the recent\n   branch buffs and immediately ambushing a player with adjacent paralysis\n   and damnation or making melee characters wade through 5+ curse skulls\n   in an open layout, considering the\n\n * evilmike_ambush is now nerfed in a variety of branches, by using\n   hand-picked spawns usually from the given branch it spawns in. The sheer\n   hostility of the vault was less of a concern when far more of the later\n   branches had far more harmless spawns in them, but this was heavily\n   aggravated by the revision to hell's sets and the introduction of\n   things like Blink Allies Encircling and berserkable tmons. Most of the\n   branch placements still have sheer volume and a few notable threats\n   at such high quantities, anyway.\n\n * Air zigs now use wind drakes and ironbound thunderhulks, to add a little\n   more variety.",

      "message": "Reflavour Ijyb into an artificer\n\nWhile we don't need to represent every single last past and future player\noption available, one background lacking much for monster representation\nalready has a perfect fit for it. Ijyb is distinguished by always having an\nearly high-tier wand since 1a4ba80, much like Artificer's wand of iceblast.\nWhile a hypothetically more deliberate artificer unique would want for more\nitems to use, a unique with an early strong one can avoid handing out too\nmuch loot at once and also avoid the heavy burden of making non-wand\nevokers work for monsters. Ijyb also has a variety of old lines like\n\"Me kill you!\" and \"Die!\", deeply generic lines that can be easily replaced\nwith repurposed, long-unused lines written up for Pakellas.\n\nIjyb's new title is the Inquisitive. Her description and dialogue now\nemphasizes her experimental homemade wand (thus also explaining how she has\none so early in D) as well as using her foes as new test subjects. She\nstill keeps her usual manner of speech despite the new vocabulary, which\nshould help give her somewhat distinct dialogue overall, too.\n\nNone of Ijyb's stats are themselves are changed, since she's already plenty\ndangerous. Maybe she should always have a club and not a coinflip chance\nfor a dagger, like Artificers start with?",

This code\nmade various assumptions like: there is always a layout, a level always\nhas vaults, and a layout is always at position 0 of the level vault\nvector. bc18a39e1d331e tried to fix some of these assumptions, but\ndidn't really handle the case where a level has no vaults at all (can be\ntrue in the abyss), which leads to an empty level vault vector.\n(Accessing position 0 of such a vector may fail to crash under various\ncompiler and runtime circumstances...)\n\nThis commit refactors to (i) reuse previously existing, slightly more\nrobust code to find the vault at a position, and (ii) adds a function to\ntry to more robustly find a layout if one exists. It's unclear to me\nwhether the position 0 assumption was or wasn't safe if there is a\nlayout (it wasn't guaranteed, but may have been true in practice), but\nthis code doesn't make it. As far as I can tell this works with the dis\nstatue case.",

      "message": "Make groups of monsters handle diagonal chokepoints more consistently\n\nSometimes a monster that can attack the player will instead walk to the\nside to let a friend move forward and help. For example, when fighting a\npack of yaks near the corner of a corridor\n\n: #####\n: #.YYY\n: #@###\n: #.###\n\nthe lead yak has a 50% chance of moving west into the corner instead of\nattacking the player.\n\nThis behavior didn't work right in one particular type of situation:\n\n: ###YY\n: ###YY\n: ..Y##\n: .@.##\n: ...##\n\nIt used to be that the lead yak would never move south or west in such\na situation, even though in the similar situation with an extra wall\n\n: ###YY\n: ###YY\n: ..Y##\n: .@###\n: ...##\n\nit would have the expected 50% chance of moving west. (There was a similar\nissue as well with the player moved one square north in the preceding two\ndiagrams.)\n\nThis commit tries to fix this, so you will no longer be safe fighting one\nyak at a time in the second diagram above. Other behavior is hopefully\nunchanged.\n\nNote that in the situation\n\n: ###YY\n: ###YY\n: .@Y##\n: .#.##\n: ...##\n\nthe yak will still never move south - this is because currently monsters\nwill only change their move by a 45 degree turn, not a 90 degree turn as\nwould be needed here. The goal of this commit isn't to make groups of\nmonsters as smart as possible, but just to fix a single weirdness/bug with\nthe old behavior.",

Worldbinders now summon ironbound\nfrosthearts instead, which may have autohit attacks but also hurt for less\ndamage while respecting more AC and being much easier to resist.

(Translocations is grouped together\nwith Summoning, as we have few workable translocations themes for vaults.)\nThese conduits help a couple of magical portals and branches beyond the\nrecent occasional presence of bookcases- Ice Caves, Volcanoes, Wizlabs,\nSnake, Elf, Crypt, and Zot. They also provide some more workable flavour\nfor the spell-gifting gods who don't give spellbooks, Kiku and Vehumet,\nplus a small number of particularly magic-focused vaults deeper on- across\nVaults and Depths.\n\nThe latter is a different tile and description for crystal walls, and serve\nas links to the various demonic planes of regular games and extended for\na multitude demonic vaults without all of them leaning too hard on demonic\nvegetation or lava (as clashes with quite a few other themes). They don't\nactually spawn inside Hell / Pan / Abyss themselves, but there's a large\nnumber of demonic vaults across D, Depths, Zot, and so on that can\nreasonably fit a little window into Cocytus or Pan or the Abyss.\n\nThe conduits are a mix of snw-0's first spell icon for Battlesphere, the\nrltiles original iron golem, and a variety of subtle overlays using\nontoclasm's item type icons. The bedeviled crystal combines quite a few\nparts- roctavian's old lugonu altar, snw-0's grey crystal recolouring,\njpeg's original strange machine for Tukima's wizlab, and depending on\nthe crystal: dd's lava, snw-0's recolouring of roctavian's floor_frozen,\nDenzi's cobalt_stone + wall_bars + floor_demonic, roctavian and due's edits\nof Denzi's iron walls, and the original rltiles work on floor_nerves.",

      "message": "New decoration duo: silver statues, scintillating statues\n\nWe've got a small number of god / theme statues around already, like Gozag\nand TSO's golden saint statues. This could be extended further for both\nflavour and visual variety purposes, and so these two follow suit.\n\nThe former are metal statue of order, law, security, and stasis. These are\nobviously used in vaults for Zin, but also employed in the Vaults, a place\nfull of metal, disciplined guards, and rather monotonous features and\nterrain beyond sparing glass or bookcases. (Yes, there's undead in the\nbranch, but these statues aren't direct links to Zin, and guards in\ndifferent areas can have different faiths. Think of the Crypt as being\nactively sealed away inside the branch.)\n\nThe latter are rainbow stone statues, representative of chaos and chance.\nThere's enough Xom and Nemelex vaults for them to fill out a respectable\nnumber, alongside some klown-centric vaults in Zot and a rare flashiness\ncomponent for Gauntlet exteriors. Worth of note is that this comes with a\ncouple of highly chaotic Xom and Lugonu vaults being made consistently\ntraversible and instead emphasizing these fancy animated statues, removing\nthe need to fill them with no_tele_into spaces and letting them serve as\nproperly transparent rather than vetoing at random.\n\nThe former combines the sparkles of roctavian's Zin altar, Denzi's silver\nstar without that altar's hand in front of it, and the pedestal of\nontoclasm's old silver statues before those were turned into obsidian\nstatues. The latter uses ontoclasm's statue plinths alongside CanOfWorms's\npieces from Xom's chessboard. (If we make more evokers in the future, they\nprobably should shift further yet from what the either of those did,\nanyway.)\n\n(This also removes the no_random vault tag, used literally nowhere besides\nwizlab_cigotuvi's doors, because it didn't work for any non-door purposes\nand the support for it also made animations themselves not consistently\nwork. This also does a fair bit of header clean-up and updating for some\nof the enemy using vaults, chaotic or not.)",

      "message": "Make and use a hidden metal statue feature\n\nWe've got a pair of explicitly metallic statue types in vaults that don't\nactually deconstruct into metal: iron statues in Dis, and golden statues in\nboth TSO and Gozag vaults. Further updates will add another two statues\nthat are also clearly not made of rock. Metal walls behave noticeably\ndifferently from rock walls- alongside the relatively unimportant matters\nof LRD messages / damage and Shatter difficulty, most relevantly they're\nalso not diggable. Statues ostenibly made of metal can pick up these\nproperties, especially when reserved for rarer theme vaults; it also\nheavily reduces the subvault hacking needed to set two different statues\nwith two different descriptions within the same vault.\n\nThe tile flips upside-down snw-0's DNGN_STATUE_TRIANGLE tile and recolours\nit with ontoclasm's impish iron statue tile, though both the base feature\nand the tile both shouldn't be seen by default- the regular metal statues\nthemselves __are not to be used by vaults__, and instead as bases for\nspecific vault flavoured statues.\n\nThis also mildly edits raw_feature_description in directn.cc to accomodate\nletting layout code use set_feature_name, so the iron statues in Dis's\nlayout_subdivisions have the same iron statue name and description as all\nof the vaults in the branch do. This probably shouldn't be too much of a\nconcern regarding preserving given vault flavour versus given layouts,\nsince we're not otherwise usually changing feature names for entire layouts\ntoo often.",

      "message": "Juggle around console statue and fountain glyphs\n\nThe more decorative statue types we add to the game and the more\nvault-exclusive custom statues still linger around, the more awkward it\nis that monster statues share a glyph with decorative feature types. They\ndon't really trick people between the monster list and autoexclusions,\nanyway, though their flavour as an actual monster is already flavour enough.\n\nThis moves monster statues in console from 8 to I- immotile non-plants.\nThis should help those still sticking to ASCII deal with future decorative\nstatue type additions by splitting them up so 8 stays as an entirely\ndecorative glyph. Also, in unicode, this moves decorative statues, from\n8 to ß- the eszett still looks like an 8, but either unicode mode tends to\navoid using alphanumeric characters for anything that isn't a monster.\n\nSomewhat seperately, in ASCII fountains share a glyph with runes and\nmisc evocables, which is completely absurd. I'm moving it to -, since\nthere are plans for other dungeon installations that don't block movement\nor projectiles and that can reasonably share the same glyph. It's hopefully\nnot too confusable with _, which frequently have changing colours, anyway.",

      "message": "Fix dactions not being processed after level peek (Darby)\n\nEach level stores an index into the global list of scheduled dactions\nthat reflects 'the last daction that was done on this level'. The idea\nbeing that whenever you reenter a level where you've already been, it will\nuse this index to process only the 'new' dactions that have been added\nsince you were there last.\n\nThe problem is that (for some reason), the dactions_done wasn't actually\nbeing marshalled properly, but the game was assuming that it was impossible\nto save a floor without all dactions being caught up. And this is\ndistinctly NOT the case in at least one situation (and maybe more): level\nexcursions!\n\nEssentially, making a level excursion to any floor would cause any dactions\nscheduled (but not yet processed on that floor) to never happen there.\nAn easy way to demonstrate this is by pulling Kirke to another floor, away\nfrom her hogs, and killing her there. Then peeking back at the old level.\nIf you did this, and then returned for real, the hogs left behind would\nnever transform back, since the excursion had made the game save that\nfloor's dactions_done as 'total number of dactions that exist'.\n\nThis potentially affects countless things, in a wide variety of stuations.\nEven doing things with the shopping list triggers level excursions, which\nwould have invalidated daction state on the floor with the shop, I'm\npretty sure.\n\nThis fix is a very simple one, and seems to work (and feels like what this\ncode always should have been). But it's possible I'm overlooking something,\nof course, and it can't be as simple as it seems. Fingers crossed?",

Using this bug, the player could equip seven-league and a high damage\nweapon like the lochaber axe or dark maul, and bounce around the screen\nmaking zero delay WJC attack moves.\n\nmove_player_action implicitly assumes that either an attack or a movement\nwill be attempted if it's being called: In this case, after 7bd419a0e5,\nits movement attempt was being blocked, and there was no target monster\nleft to attack, so it eventually just returned without applying time_taken\nor ending the turn.\n\nThis commit hopefully fixes the bug, by applying attack delay and ending\nthe turn if our rampage target dies during WJC postmoves.",
