      "message": "Some further improvements to tracers against invisible players\n\nThe approach of the previous commit could very slightly wrong in some\ncases, since hit_count can be incremented even by actions that might not\ncall tracer_affect_player() (for instance, explosions prior to their\nexplode phase). Since what we're actually concerned about is that monsters\ndon't believe they can hit the player repeatedly - overpowering all\nfriendly fire concerns - put the check for duplicate player hits in the\ntracer itself.\n\nIn addition, change fuzzing behavior so that monsters will not believe the\nplayer could be standing in a wall or on top of their own allies. While\nthere are probably multiple bugs this results in, one I am specifically\naware of is that monsters will stop casting healing/buffing beams near an\ninvisible player, since they think the player is standing on top of all\ntheir allies.",

This leads to penetrating tracers\ndouble counting the player for the purposes of friendly fire\ncalculations (and would lead to more than that, except that no beam can\nhit anything thrice).\n\nWe fix this by not counting more hits on the player than bounces+1.\nThis is a bit crude, but works in all cases except a bouncing beam\nthat misses the player on the first pass and hits twice thereafter,\nwhich seems likely rare.",

      "message": "Rework choosing tiles for items\n\nNormal, shiny, runed, glowing and randart versions of an item can all\nget their own tile. For an item with all variations we would define a\ntile group with 5 tiles in it for the item and then use tile 1 for\nnormal, tile 2 for shiny, tile 3 for runed, tile 4 for glowing and tile\n5 for randart. We could also only put 4 tiles in the group in which case\nshiny and runed items would get the same tile, or 3 tile in the group so\nthat shiny, runed and glowing items all get the same tile, or 2 items in\nthe group so that all non-normal items get the same tile, or 1 item in\nthe group so that all items get the same tile.\n\nThis usually worked well, however, there were a couple problems. First,\nfor an item to with one tile for artifacts and one tile for everything\nelse, you would either add special case tile picking code for this item\nor duplicate its non-artifact tile so that its tile group consisted of\nits non-artifact tile, its non-artifact tile duplicate, and then its\nartifact tile. Secondly, some items have multiple tiles for normal\nversions of the item or for artifacts etc. This would require special\ncasing the item tile picking code to handle the item. All this special\ncasing resulted in item tile picking being a hard to modify mess.\n\nWe have a very similar problem when picking tiles for walls and floors\nof different colours and the solution to that problem can easily be\nused to fix our item tile picking mess by replacing colour (e.g. red,\ngreen, etc) with enchanted level (e.g. shiny, randart etc).",

      "message": "Improve handling of permanent creations of summoned/charmed monsters\n\nThere has been a recurring class of bug over the years where permanent\nmonsters made as part of another monster behavior (for instance, protean\nprogenitor death spawns or mangrove fauna) would not properly inherit some\nof the properties of their parents. Namely, if you charmed the original, or\nsummoned it (perhaps by a scroll), any monster made be it would be\npermanently friendly.\n\nThere was bespoke handling for a subset of these cases for some monsters,\nbut this was fairly incomplete (and different from monster to monster).\n\nThis commit adds a simple, unified way to inherit the charm and summon\nstatus of a given 'parent' monster. It then revises code for The Royal\nJelly, protean progenitors, shambling mangroves, and bennu revival to use\nthis (fixing an assortment of bugs in the process).\n\nIt is possible there are other cases which should make use of it that I\nhave overlooked, but they would now be simple to address once pointed out.",

      "message": "Rework BEAM_CHAOS functionality\n\nBEAM_CHAOS was rather odd in some ways and behaved like neither the weapon\nbrand nor the cloud. Since it applied its non-damaging effects entirely\nvia enchantment beams, it did not have access to the same set of secondary\neffects as other sources of chaos, and unlike chaos weapons, did no damage\nwhatsoever if it rolled a status effect (though the hit message could\nmisleadingly suggest it did do damage!). Its status effects also checked\nWill, unlike other chaos sources (but only when the player was the one\nbeing hit!) and could roll irrelevant effects that other chaos sources\nwould exclude (such as Weakness on a monster with no attacks).\n\nNow, it instead picks a random damage element, and then has a 50% chance of\napplying a status effect on top of it, using the chaos_affects_actor() code\nshared by other chaos sources. (The old chance of applying a status effect\nwas ~62%).\n\nIn addition, wording of the beam hits is changed so that it indicates what\nelement of damage is being done.\n\nThis is a relatively significant change to the damage componant of Awaken\nFlesh, which should be a little more capable of actually doing something to\nthe player (and will be even more relevant for some 0.35 monster plans).",

On top of this, it could print\nsomewhat confusing messages about 'missing' the player, regardless of\nwhether the player was now standing in a cloud or not.\n\nThese spells now function purely as cloud delivery and the direct beam\nprints no additional messages about whether they 'hit' a target or not.\n\nThis comes with some additional tracer improvements where 0 damage cloud\nbeams will check the validity of their cloud against a monster target\n(rather than assuming they will have no effect since they do no impact\ndamage)",

      "message": "Fix cloud targeting for non-players\n\nAfter 2322c751, the cloud targeter required having player LOS_NO_TRANS\nfor any potential cloud location, regardless of the agent. This doesn't\nmake sense for either monster agents or dungeon cloud generators. For\nthe latter, it meant that cloud generators wouldn't place clouds not on\ntheir position until the player had LOS_NO_TRANS. This would give\nplayers who could see cloud generators e.g. through glass a false\nimpression of how many clouds a generator would place.\n\nThis commit requires drops the LOS_NO_TRANS condition when there is no\nagent. When there is an agent, the requirement is based on the agent's\nLOS, instead of always on the player's.",

A lot of this initialization code isn't appropriate to rerun on\na reused state. Things like setting metatables that already exist,\nregistering C functions that are already registered etc. With the switch\nto Lua 5.4, this was resulting in crashes during reinitialization. This\ncommit has crawl close the lua states of clua/dlua before\nreinitialization. This seems cleaner and more thorough rather than more\nseletively reloading things on a more case by case basis and add little\noverhead.",

It didn't\ncount as killing it for the purpose of opening the rune vault, either\nforcing the player to track it down in the Abyss and kill it there or give\nup on the rune entirely (or switch to Jiyva). But even if one went to the\nAbyss, TRJ could still be lost forever - a single Abyss shift after\nencountering it would remove it from the game altogether.\n\nBut with the new addition of slimy stairs, rather than simply blocking\naccess to the rune, banishing TRJ now locks the played into Slime:5,\nsometimes with no other recourse but to join Jiyva. This places new urgency\non an old oddity.\n\nOther alternatives were considered (such as opening an immediate portal to\nthe Abyss for the player to track TRJ, along with preventing them from\never being lost), but fighting TRJ in the Abyss seems like such a mistake\nin general that this would open happen to unaware players or by accident.\nUltimately, I think it's not worth preserving, and have opted for this\nsimple change instead. If anyone wants justification, assume that Jiyva is\nkeeping a special hold on their most important follower, so close to the\nheart of their power.",

      "message": "Refactor checks for whether actors are able to move under their own power\n\nThis renames player::is_motile() to player::cannot_move() (inverting its\nlogic) and implements cannot_move() as an actor method (checking both\nstationary() and ENCH_BOUND for monsters). Many checks specifically for\nENCH_BOUND are replaced by this new method.\n\nThis also fixes a handful of other issues:\n -Monsters with ENCH_BOUND are allowed to be trampled (it only prevents\n  volitional movement, and never any form of knockback).\n -Monsters with ENCH_BOUND can drag enemies towards them, so long as this\n  action would not ask them to also move.\n -Slick slippers can make the player slip away from attacks even if the\n  attacker cannot follow them.\n -Concussion weapons will no longer move their wielders forward if they\n  cannot move.\n\nThis fixes #4975",

It should now be\nimpossible for the player to act so quickly that they get a second turn\nbefore it blows up.",

      "message": "Fix some odd behavior caused by monsters being distracted by their allies\n\nBeams hitting monsters fire ME_ANNOY events, even when hostile monsters\nare hitting their allies (and even when those hits are doing 0 damage). To\nsome degree this is necessary, since this is what controls breaking Daze,\nFear, or waking monsters up. However, there is a chain of other\nconsequences that can sometimes result in negative effects.\n\nME_ANNOY unconditionally sets that monster's foe to the source of that\nevent. handle_behavior() will later automatically set any monster whose\nfoe is an ally of theirs to MHITNOT. Then any of those monsters that are\nBEH_SEEK + MHITNOT will automatically target the player if the player is\nin LoS - or immediately start wandering if they are not (or if the monster\nis an exploder).\n\nThis means, essentially, that any friendly fire among monsters will cause\nall monsters out of LoS to immediately forget about the player - even if\nthey were immune to the attack. One of the most easy to observe examples\ninvolves Lom Lobon, whose ball lightning explosions can give them rapid\namnesia (and are also likely to blow up on them while the player flees),\nbut this can happen under many other circumstances. It can also make ball\nlightning themselves start wandering away while still in LoS.\n\nNow, we no longer update a monster's foe if trying to set it to nothing or\nan ally. This... hopefully doesn't have any other unforeseen negative\neffects, but behavior code is such a snarl...",

      "message": "Make Slime stairs slimy, and tweak layout\n\nSlime is a branch almost exclusively dived through quickly. The lack of any\nloot in the branch, combined with the disconnected layout frequently\nplacing down stairs in view of up stairs while giving little reason to\nexplore any other bubbles, meant that time spent anywhere but Slime:5 was\noften very brief. Now that the monster pool has been greatly expanded, it\nseems appropriate to ask players venturing here to engage with it a little\nmore.\n\nAt the same time, Slime had grown to be widely viewed as the 'easy' 3rd\nrune option, and one goal of this batch of commits is to make that less\ntrue - not necessarily to make it the 'hard' 3rd rune, but to bring it\ncloser to perceived parity with Vaults:5.\n\nTo that end (as well as to create a little more uniqueness in the branch),\nstairs in Slime are now slimy: they can be taken downward but not travelled\nback up again until The Royal Jelly is defeated (unless the player worships\nJiyva themselves). This is functionally a little different than hatches,\nsince alpha-striking TRJ and then fleeing *does* allow the player to leave\nand regroup, and the path back up again is known, but otherwise makes each\nnew floor an isolated challenge at first.\n\nIn addition, the level generator no longer produces disconnected floors\n(though it still uses layout_caves), hatches and shafts cannot generate,\ndown stairs are now allowed to spawn adjacent to slimy walls (up stairs\nstill cannot), and down stairs will always be placed at least 12 tiles away\nfrom any up stair. All together, while the zone should still be\ndive-friendly, one should no longer be able to trivially skip past most of\nit so quickly, and levels before Slime:5 should matter more.",

      "message": "New Slime monster: Star Jelly (and consequent Void Ooze tweaks)\n\nStar jellies (inspired by the real phenomenon) are mid-tier slime monsters\nwho unleash a trio of shooting stars (as from an orb of stardust) when\nsufficiently damaged (on a long cooldown). To keep from it being frequently\ncorrect to ignore them (since they are most immediately dangerous to the\nplayer upon being damaged), they also have antimagic melee. This may also\nhelp mildly counterbalance the fact that the shooting stars are most\ndangerous if unleashed in melee.\n\nIn exchange, void oozes trade their own antimagic melee (which almost never\ndid anything in practice, due to its incredibly low base damage) for a new\nAF_DIM that applies Diminished Spells to the target (and ignores AC).\n\nUnlike the other new slime monsters, these are now a possible Royal Jelly\nspawn as well, where their shooting star effect may provide some\ninteresting complications to traditional ?immo strats.\n\n(I've also slightly lowered the max pursuit distance on shooting stars. I\nsuspect this will not have a very meaningful effect on the orb of stardust,\nbut should make it a little more possible to flee from them as a player.)\n\n--------------------------\n\nThe star jelly vault distribution and tiles were done by regret-index.\n * The star jelly tiles combine rejected slime creature tiles by\n   roctavian with Denzi's original jelly tile.\n * Vault distribution still is limited to Slime, one Depths vault, a\n   few Sprints, and Ziggurats, where they replace scaling azure jelly\n   placement in Slime floors to threaten mass conjurations spam.\n   They also join Jiyva's wrath pool, to match the other TRJ spawns.",

      "message": "New Slime monster: Creeping plasmodium\n\nThese are motile slime mold colonies that can replicate themselves along\nwalls in a unique manner and inflict large scale AoE acid damage if allowed\nto grow out of control.\n\nCreeping Plasmodium are wall-only monsters that create Caustic Sporangium -\nball-lightning-esque monsters that detonate with a 7x7 acid explosion.\nUniquely, any wall tiles engulfed by this explosion will also spawn a\nNascent Plasmodium (as long as they are two tiles away from any existing\nsporangium). These are lesser wall-bound monsters that cast acid ball -\nless dangerous than their parents and unable to replicate, but still\ncontributing more and more ranged acid damage. They will all die when the\noriginal plasmodium dies, but do not otherwise expire with time!\n\nNot only do I feel that the monster design flavorfully captures the\nuncontrollable spread of slime, but it also asks unique positioning on the\npart of the player, since maneuvering the explosions to avoid walls can be\nvery important unless you're about to close in for the kill.\n\nThey are comparatively rare monsters in the branch and specifically do not\nspawn naturally on Slime:5.\n\n------------------------\n\nThe plasmodium vault distribution and tiles were done by regret-index.\n * The plasmodium tiles combine Ontoclasm's current Lair rock wall tiles\n   and old ballistomycete spore trail tiles with CC0 scales by\n   ARoachIFoundOnMyPillow.\n * The sporangium tile tweaks a spell icon by 7Soul1, and the launching\n   spell icon adjusts the ballistomycete sporulation icon by aidanholm.\n * Vault distribution is very sparse, barring more tiles to help Slime\n   vaults stand out at all versus the rest of the level.",

      "message": "New Slime monster: Slymdra (regret-index)\n\nCombining the head mechanics famous on hydras (but used nowhere else) with\na variant of slime creature merging behaviors, these are terrifying melee\nmonsters for Slime.\n\nThey have acid-branded melee attacks and start with 4-5 heads, but can\npassively absorb adjacent slime creatures to grow an additional head for\neach one (and gain a bunch of HP in the process). Unlike normal slime\ncreatures, their constituant slimes will not passively split off from them\nagain while in combat, but if left wandering for a little while, will\ngradually separate (meaning that fleeing from one that gets out of control\ncan still allow it to shrink back down again). Polymorphing one also spits\nout any additional slime creatures it has absorbed.\n\nHead mechanics operate almost identically to hydra; bladed weapons chop\nheads and make new ones grow while flaming weapons can remove heads\naltogether. Any new heads made this way will produce only unrewarding\nslime creatures if separated (so no infinite slime creature farming).\n\nThey spawn with a small slime creature band (and the branch itself is full\nof them), so attempting to position such that they absorb as few as\npossible may be important - their corrosion inflicting melee obviously\nscales non-linearly with how rapidly they can attack you!\n\n-----------------------------\n\nSlymdra vault distribution and tiles were done by regret-index.\n * The slymdra tiles combine ontoclasm's Hydra Form tile with roctavian's\n   old soul eater and brown ooze tiles.\n * Vault distribution is limited to a slim number of Slime vaults looking\n   for specific monsters, one Zot vault, variable Sprints, and Ziggurats.\n   In the last of these, they replace scaling rockslime placement on Slime\n   floors and scale additional heads with completed Zigs.",

      "message": "New monster: morphogenic oozes, for Slime\n\n(Unlike the previous two, this doesn't really count as a revival of\nsomething removed from Slime- in this case, pulsating lumps- even with\nthe most tenuous of connections.)\n\nThese morphogenic oozes are another rare high-tier threat meant to provide\nvariety for Slime. Such ichoate masses directly try to show something\notherwise quite absent in the current Slime opposition and instead\nregulated to just Jiyva worship itself: the actual conversion of the\nprevious civilization into slime. As such, they have the new AF_SLIMIFY,\nwhich isn't instant for players: each branded attack builds up 35 to 45\naut of a Slimifying status on living players, which when maxed out at\n100 aut will turn one into the newly revived jelly form (for the polymorph\nstandard of 20 to 50 turns). This has the following effects:\n\n * Built-in jelly-emulating rPois, rCorr, acidic walls immunity,\n   rBlind, SInv, and amorphous's rConstrict\n * All equipment but jewellery melded\n * AC scaling to a quarter of XL, +25% HP, and the same size and EV\n * Passable acidic unarmed melee scaling to XL\n * Double negative magic enhancers for all spells\n\n(Most of these bonuses are present to help properly emulate current\ninnate jelly properties with some incidental defensive benefits in Slime\nitself. On other fronts, jewellery not being melded is deliberate between\npseudopods reasonably matching up with octopode tentacles and there being\nstill branch resists a jelly can care about like Will+ and rC+ and rN+.\nSince Dissolution can still invoke Jiyva, and with void oozes having had\ntheir spell-affecting flooding effects heavily buffed this version, I\ndecided to experiment with negative enhancers like old shadow Form did as\nhurting magic in a different fashion instead of fiddling with success\nrates or turning off spells entirely.)\n\n(UI-wise, this commit also adds red message highlighting for being\npolymorphed or fully slimified, since it's as highly threatening as\nother full disabling effects. With our very lacking badform look-up\navailable in-game, I've opted for a short parenthetical clipped to the\nend of the description, which is somewhat unideal, but is also about as\nmuch as is reasonable to handle in the scope of this version.)\n\nWhile these are quite nasty for heavier armour characters and blasting\nmages, these are still gentler effects than most other polymorph badforms\n(which either disable movement or casting entirely, and which can turn off\neven jewellery resists), and the build-up should give a reasonable amount\nof recourse for people properly prioritizing them for such a threat. (For\nthe far-less-common case of living monsters being struck by this, I've\nopted instead for a flat 1/4 chance for each hit to polymorph a monster\ninto the standard Slimify list. Since orc apostles have rPolymorph, this\nwill mostly just affect summoning spells weirdly.)\n\nLike most high-tier slimes, these have high speed, decent health, and poor\nAC, though they also get better EV than almost any other slime as a\nnotably fluctuating mass. They come in bands of 2 oozes plus 0-3 golden\neyes and great orbs of eyes- with the split ooze count trying to reduce\nthe pressure to make individual slimes have even higher numbers than the\ncurrent top-end slimes, and with the eyes trying to abuse the melding of\nWill+ randart armour. They're rare enough there's only about a ~60% chance\nto see one of their bands each Slime visit, and they're directly excluded\nfrom Slime:5 + TRJ's spawn list (but not Jiyva's wrath!)- aside from\ncontinuing to avoid making TRJ's fight more complicated, their flavour as\njust-converted slimes also matches with colossal amoeba as working very\nstrangely inside TRJ itself.\n\nThe morphogenic ooze tile combines Denzi's old soul eaters, a piece for\na future spriggan wellspring by LemurRobot, and a rejected merged slime\ncreature tile by roctavian. The jellyform tile combines the current jelly\ntile by Bloax with a CC0 slime sample by Henry Software.",

      "message": "Revive eyes of draining as rare deep negative energy eyes (DracoOmega)\n\nAnother significantly revised monster revival meant mostly to help with\nmore variety for a branch lacking in it. Eyes of draining were removed\nin 049c24a for being harmless to magic-less builds, entirely harmless\nwithout other enemies, and being too slow (at speed 5) to actually stick\nto other enemies as they were otherwise supposed to spawn with. These\nrevived eyes of draining try to address all of these matters, while also\ndealing with a weird bit of inconsistency in \"Draining Gaze\" having no\nconnection to other draining effects\n\n * These now have normal speed actions, M_CAUTIOUS, and fast movement.\n   (Mostly, this means trying to walk away to keep them out of LOS is\n    entirely unteneable without additional help.)\n\n * They now count as the leader for their band, so other monsters will\n   follow them if they get ahead. (They also get somewhat customized\n   bands in Slime, to always place a very-loosely-connected monster\n   that actually deals damage to finish the player off.)\n\n * They lose their previous antimagic theming to serve as a serious rN\n   check, with the new Draining Gaze doing no damage to instead directly\n   drain for 10% of one's max health post-draining. (Following casts will\n   drain 9%, then 8.1%, then 7.29%, and so on).\n\n(While this does lead to them being harmless to those with full rN+++,\nwhich several species get for free, this is hardly an unknown consequence\nto Crawl- compare to how harmless death drakes are to the undead species\ntrio. rN is also no stranger to monsters that struggle to directly kill\nplayers, as tormentors still functional well in doing. Slime also has\nenough other prominent resist checks enough that a rare divergence to\nvalue one of the currently least-valuable resists should be fine as an\noccasional novelty of a threat.)\n\nThese spawn rarely in Slime, with an average low enough one appears in\nonly about 40% of all Slime visits: shining eyes already serve as plenty\nof strategic damage, and giving Slime more variety also includes aiming for\nsome high-tier rare threats. They also spawn extremely rarely at the very\ntop end of the D out-of-depths pool, replacing the collective weight of\nshadow dragons (similiar big rN check that should only spawn later with the\nother top-tier dragons), war gargoyles, and iron dragons (both of which\nhave changes slated in the future to handle being placed so late that their\nMetal Splinters almost never functions.) They also get some negative\nenergy theme placements in Ziggurats and Sprints, and one eye vault\nplacement in Depths.\n\n(This commit also changes orange crystal statues, ghost moths, and Norris\nto be casting \"Antimagic Gaze\" instead of \"Draining Gaze\", with adjusted\ntile options between each of them. Hopefully, people won't confused about\nthis for too long- it's the more intuitive reading of Draining in a game\nwith so much draining costs and draining attacks, anyway.)\n\nTheir new tile and gaze vfx tweaks roctavian's edit of Denzi's old eye of\ndraining tile, while combining them with unused negative energy\nprojectiles also made by roctavian. The spell icon combines Denzi's\ndivinations eye with CanOfWorms's Powered By Death icons, and the\nreplacement Antimagic Gaze icon combines that eye with ontoclasm's Sap\nMagic icon. This also adjusts the splash screen art by Peileppe and Bloax\nto roughly approximate the monster's newer colours.",

      "message": "New(?) monster: colossal amoeba, for Slime\n\nThe overall enemy variety and unique enemy count for the Slime Pits are\nseverely low for a third rune branch in general, with 13 regular monsters\nand a highly restrictive theme blocking off vaults from using much leaving\nthe branch lagging behind nearly every other full branch in the game. As\nit has become more and more popular to take it as a third rune relative to\nthe branch falling behind buffs to players and Vaults alike, the branch\nmostly being propped up on acid blobs and the one fixed fight of the Royal\nJelly becomes more conspicuously simple and flat compared to most other\nbranches having regular vaults and far more guests. As such, any new\nmonsters that can nudge up the difficulty and variety alike are reasonably\nvaluable, especially after the removal of five previous jellies and eyes\nfrom the branch ended up with the branch deploying ~92 or so slime\ncreatures each game.\n\nThese colossal amoebae, blue 'J's in console, bare no real mechanical\nresemblance to the giant amoebae removed back in cd953f7 for lacking any\nunique mechanical identity. They instead have two flavourful attack brand\ngimmicks: they undergo mitosis and cell division through the\nself-summoning AF_SWARM of marrowcuda (0aa0afc), and that rapidly\nexpanding mass pulls in and consume foes through AF_DRAG (24261f8). They\nhave fairly high health (a bit above tentacled monstrosities, or on par\nwith three slime creatures) and demonic-crawler-level regeneration but\npoor resists and defenses otherwise, and should be reasonably\nstraightforward and flavourful without particularly increasing Slime's\noverall complexity- their weighting takes out a scaling fraction of slime\ncreature spawns (swapping ~5 amoeba for 14 of ~92 average slime\ncreatures), plus a tiny bit of azure jellies as are a little weak but\nawkward to change with early ice cave use. Their play patterns are a\nlittle weird- far less easy to destroy from afar than most of Slime and\nless vulnerable to AOE compared to slime creatures, but also inherently\nneeding to pierce lategame player defences to actually start swarming and\ndragging. (To this end, they have a small chance scaling with depth to\nget a glowing orange brain or glass eye as organ support.) They should\nstill be novel enough, at least.\n\n(Also, despite being sort of high-tier slimes in practice, these colossal\namoebae are notably not joining TRJ's or Jiyva's 5* Jelly expulsion spawn\nselection, as they feel less pure slime than the current already-wide\nselection- compare to how formless jellyfish didn't get into those lists\neither.)\n\nTheir tile is a taller modification of ontoclasm's old giant amoeba tile.",

      "message": "Fix crashing volcano triggers\n\nThis commit contains a fix for erroneous lua map marker behaviour seen\nwhen hellmonk_volcano_collapse places as well as a fix to the event\ndispatcher to prevent this behaviour from crashing the game. The first\nfix will allow the map to create its markers properly when it places.\nThe second will prevent games from crashing where the map has generated\nalready with incorrect markers. I'll discuss both fixes more below.\n\nRegarding the lua map maker behaviour, something odd is happening under\nlua 5.4 with a closure that's used directly as a lua map marker. In\nlm_trig.lua, the funciton Triggerable.synchronized_markers() creates a\nclosure with an upvalue `first` that initially true and supposed to be\nset to false after the first call to the closure. After that, the\nmarkers this function makes will be so-called \"replica\" property\nmarkers. What's happening in practice is that modifications to `first`\naren't being retained by subsequent calls, so all markers being placed\nare primary ones (i.e. TriggerrableFunction). Strangely, this problem\ngoes away if the lua state context is exited from the closure before\n`first` is examined. That is, if I add calls to e.g. `crawl.mpr()` or to\nthe `io` library, subsequent calls to the closure see the updated\n(false) value for `first`. My fix was to store the primary\ninitialization in the Triggerable table (keyed by replica id) rather\nthan updating an upvalue. But this should be considered a workaround, as\nit's very concerning if closures/upvalues aren't behaving properly.\n\nFor the second fix to dgn_event_dispatcher, it seems that this class is\na bit naive in expecting the listeners in its internal list to be valid.\nSince it fires off events to dlua that can execute arbitrary code, it's\ncertainly possible an arbitrary map marker in the dispatcher's list\nmight get removed (meaning it's an invalid listener object).\ndgn_event_dispatcher::fire_event() already makes a copy of its listeners\nbefore firing events because directly iterating over this list is unsafe\nfor the same reason. Since the copied list might contain a pointer to a\ndeleted map marker, I've added a method to verify that a listener is\nactually in the master list. This is checked before attempting to fire\noff a dungeon event on a listener.",
