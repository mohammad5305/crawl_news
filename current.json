Uses hat tiles that are rarely\nencountered elsewhere. Since it only places good items, have it\nshow up fairly deep.\"\n\n[Committer's notes: Cleaned up a bit of logic code checking. Since the\nnostalgia has overflowed so far that the dwarf came back entirely, name the\nshop after the granny his dialogue mentions as making his hat instead.\nAlso, remove the shop from most Lair branches- Wiglaf didn't show up in\nwater branches and we don't put shops in Spider in general. Snake is fine,\nthough. Vault weight is lower due to showing off previously rather rare\ntiles and containing all these randarts and unrands, too. In exchange for\nsuch increased rarity, it now also gets a coinflip chance to contain a\nbook solely containing Wiglaf's new signature spell.\n\nThis might be a little too silly, it might be fine. We'll see how this\nlasts the years.\n\nCloses #3646.]",

I have attempted to\nprovide a suitable descriptor for the type of damage in each case,\nthough \"earth\" and \"conj\" I admit are quite weak.\n\nUnlike all the other magic skills used by magical staves, monsters were\nnot previously allocated any conjurations skill, so they would never\nget any bonus damage from staves of conjuration.

Fix this by removing the \"bonus\" column from\nAF_PURE_FIRE and listing the damage in the Max Damage column as fire.\n\nAF_DRAIN previously did not list its max damage, even though it did\nextra damage. [Sidenote: draining effects are weirdly inconsistent:\nfor monsters, AF_DRAIN deals up to damage/2 half the time,\ndraining weapons do this all the time, whereas for players, draining\nweapons do 2-4 + damage/2 but only half the time.]\n\nMost importantly, the formula for melee damage dealt by monsters is\n    damage = 1 + random2(monster attack damage)\n               + random2(weapon base damage)\n               + enchantment/slaying roll\nwhen monsters have a weapon, which has a max of\n    max = monster attack damage + weapon base damage + ench/slay - 1\nbut the -1 was not being reflected in x-v.

      "message": "Add monster weapons and brand damage to x-v\n\nIn 3dd9dd1, monster attacks were put into a table after many\ndescriptions got too long. However, in the process we lost most\nmonster weapon brands from being shown on x-v at all.\n\nThe result was that the \"max damage\" number shown on x-v was often\na lie, and there were only two ways to check monster weapon brands:\n(a) reread the message from when a monster enters LOS for the first\n    time (but note, this currently doesn't display when entering\n    a new floor sometimes due to a bug), or\n(b) use x to examine the monster, but this only works when in LOS.\n\nLet's take advantage of the new table setup in two ways: firstly,\nrather than \"(w/weapon)\" being shown for every monster weapon attack,\nlist a monster's weapon's terse description in the Attacks column\nafter \"Hit\", and secondly, add the max damage from the monster's\nweapon brand to the Max Damage column.\n\nTo make this all fit on the 80-character wide description UI, make\nthe column widths adjust themselves to the width of the text in the\ncolumns. Where this still isn't good enough, truncate the weapon\ndescription, as this is the least important part of the table.\n\nExample: Norris, wielding a +2 demon trident of draining.\nPreviously:\nAttack      Max Damage          Bonus\nHit         48                  Cause confusion\n\nNow:\nAttack                         Max Damage       Bonus\nHit: +2 demon trident (drain)  48 + 24 (drain)  Cause confusion",

      "message": "Give glowing orange brains an *actual* aura of brilliance\n\nUsing the new easy aura framework, brains provide the empowered spells buff\nto nearby allies so long as they are alive. Unlike Prayer of Brilliance,\nthis affects any monster that is antimagic-vulnerable (ie: it also works\non demons and other natural spellcasters, like eyes). This gives them an\ninteresting support function and also makes their summoning feel a little\nmore different than other Shadow Creatures users.\n\nAdditionally, they get the 'cautious' flag. Despite a synergistic spellset\nthat sounds scary in theory, brains often would spend most of their turns\nsimply walking up to let the player punch them (and they don't even have a\nmelee attack!). This makes the combination of summons/disruption/fear a\nlittle more likely that the player has to consider how to answer.",

      "message": "Replace Deep Elf Elementalist Freezing Cloud with Hoarfrost Cannonade\n\nFreezing cloud wasn't a very functional spell on these enemies. Because of\nthe unpredictable splash of monster cloud spells, the elementalist would\noften refuse to cast it at all (even in an open room with no one else\naround!) for fear of hitting themselves. And then when they did, it was\noften more dangerous to the elementalist (or other elves) than it was to\nthe player. Let's try replacing it with a different ice spell that has\nneither of these problems.\n\nI am letting monsters 'cheat' and create the cannons centered around their\nfoe, rather than themselves (both so that they can do something with it\nwhen there's a pileup of other elves in the way, and so it's less trivial\nfor the player to just stay out of range of them).",

They've lapsed a little in their worship of Okawaru,\nlosing Haste to keep them from overlapping with modern Donald too much (but\nstill know Might). They always spawn with a good randart hat and since,\nwell, everyone knows Joseph *took* that hat, they alternate with him as a\nunique pair.\n\nA tiny bit of their dialogue was restored from the old days, but after\ntrimming out the cliche drunkenness and vague racism, the vast majority of\nit is new. I did my best to manage scottish eye dialect in a similar style;\nnot sure if I have gone overboard or not.\n\nImplementation note: it's impossible in a conventional way for a monster to\nhave a hat and a shield at the same time, even using the 'usual' hack used\nfor Nikola's gloves. So I have shoved Wiglaf's hat into his jewelry slot,\nwhich I dislike rather a lot. But I'm reasonably sure that it works\nproperly.",

      "message": "Properly ascribe blame for deaths due to exploding monsters\n\nThis was broken since 3dd439832fe0f5fe295caad1a2fe3e479a757cda which caused\nall ikiller information for deaths caused by exploders (ie: ball lightning\nor fulminant prisms) to be lost. This isn't conceptually trivial to fix,\nas now the monster responsible for the explosion will already be cleaned\nup by the time the explosion happens (and the entire blame chain was stored\ninside that monster).\n\nThe fix I've settled on is to maintain a very transient cache for copies of\nmonsters that are about to explode. If a scorefile_entry tries to look up\na monster by mid and fails, it will look at this cache instead so that it\ncan find the dead monster's info as it was when the final_effect was\nfirst scheduled.\n\n(This cache is cleared as soon as fineffs are done processing, so there\nshouldn't be any need to worry about its state.)\n\nIt's possible there is some other class of fineff that could benefit from\nusing it, for similar reasons, but this wasn't immediately obvious to me.\nHowever, this should once again let us see whose fault these deaths are.\n\n(Fun fact: I'd thought that Xak'krixis was wildly underperforming, but\napparently a full 90% of their kills weren't being attributed to them. Poor\nLom also lost out on ~30% or so of their kills since the original commit).",

      "message": "Blork the Orc -> Blorkula the Orcula\n\nAs part of the Beogh overhaul, it seems like a good idea to demonstrate\nthat some orcs other than just the player have non-orcish heritage, and\nthis was one of the funnier options.\n\nBlorkula also gets a new gimmick to go with being a vampire: when he would\notherwise die, he instead splits into multiple (randomly colored!) vampire\nbats. The player has a modest length of time to kill these bats before they\npull themselves back together into a healthy Blorkula once more. (There is\na lengthly cooldown so that he cannot do it again immediately, but will\nregain that ability if the player is forced to flee).\n\nHe also gains a modest vampire bite aux and adds Sting, Sandblast, and\nShock to his spell repertoir (specifically in keeping with the recent\ngreater emphasis on his 'obsessed with different colors' theming).\n\nThis definitely makes Blork more dangerous than before, but he is currently\nthe statistically least dangerous unique of his depth range, so there is\nprobably a fair bit of headroom to buff him without concern. I have still\nnudged him down a floor, out of caution.

      "message": "feat: Buff evocable invisibility\n\nItems like the scarf of invisibility and +Inv in general have been seen\nby many players as not competitive with other items/properties for a\nwhile now.  Invis on demand is very strong and I believe still\nunderrated for combat situations by even experienced players. However\n+Inv requires high evocations investment just to receive a passable fail\nrate has a significant drain cost on top. We do want +Inv to require\nevocations investment, and drain is still the best option to limit\nspamming the ability without care, but better balance can be had.\n\nThis commit reduces the fail rate's dependency on evocations by 1/3, the\nsame fail rate as +Blink, and reduces the drain cost by 1/3. Hence with\n4/8/12 evocations skill, we get 14%/6%/1% fail rates. Complaints about\nthe drain cost are less prominent than complaints about the ability fail\nrate, but hopefully cumulatively these buffs make players consider using\n+Inv a bit more.",

Previously, the most powerful use of this spell was to\nunleash it on a group and then get the heck away so that they would slow\ndie to each other while the player was safely away. While we do allow some\nhigh level spells to have this capability, it feels like there's a lot more\nrisk baked into, eg: Discord, to counterbalance this. I'm a bit\nuncomfortable with this being the primary use-case for Rimeblight, and want\nit to feel sufficiently attractive to use while standing around for a\nfight. (The internal ice damage still occurs while out of sight, in the\nsame way that poison still works out of sight)\n\nI also increase explosion damage somewhat (though note that the increased\nrate of spread is fairly significant).\n\nWe'll see how this updated version feels to use.",

      "message": "Seismic Cannonade -> Hoarfrost Cannonade (lv 5 Ice/Alchemy)\n\nSeismic Cannonade was generally poorly received. There was some lack of\nclarity about needing to charge 1 cannon versus all cannons, perception\nthat its damage was inadequate because so much of it was back-loaded, and\nI personally felt like the possibility of 'missing' your shockwave attack\ndue to the cannons timing out unless you cast it immediately upon reaching\nfull charge was unfortunate.\n\nI don't think the idea was unsalvageable (and simply raising damage and\ncharge rate might have done a lot for it), but I've decided instead to\nshift element and try using this to address another gap in Crawl's spell\nlibrary instead. (High level earth will get another new spell shortly\ninstead).\n\nUntil the recent Permafrost Eruption, there was literally only a single\noffensive Ice spell between Frozen Ramparts and Ozocubu's Refrigeration.\nThat did a bit to help Ice's midgame being so incredible centered around\nFreezing Cloud, but an additional option at 5 should help midgame\ndiversity.\n\nHoarfrost Cannonade summons 2 hoarfrost cannons which shoot long-range\nshards that inflict the Frozen status on enemies. It inherits a greatly\nsimplified form of charge-up mechanic compared to Seismic Cannonade: the\ncannons start at full health, but each shot the cannon fires consumes a\nchunk of this health. If it survives to fire a 5th and final shard, that\nshard will explode for greater 3x3 AoE damage. No manual recast or tracking\nneeded, but the player is still incentivized to protect the cannons to let\nthem get their biggest hit off. (The explosion does no damage to friendlies\nsince its automatic nature would otherwise make it likely to either whiff\nor hurt you).\n\n(Also: more for flavor reasons than anything else, when the cannons fade\naway, they briefly leave a small puddle of water behind.)\n\nThis generally fits the tone of Ice doing 'damage over time', while still\nbeing very different than Freezing Cloud. Let's see how this one goes over.",

      "message": "Increase the effectiveness of the Frozen status\n\nFrozen was applied as a side-effect of Flash Freeze and Creeping Frost,\nbut didn't have very much impact. It lasted 2-4 turns and increased move\ndelay by 3 aut, meaning that even if you moved every one of those turns you\nwere penalized, you'd lose less than 1 turn on average. In most situations,\nI think it barely affected how the player should conduct themselves. If a\ndebuff is going to exist, I think it should be easier to notice that it did\nsomething, so let's try ramping it up slightly.\n\nFrozen now lasts 3-5 turns instead, and increases move delay by 50%\n(identical to being slowed). This is fairly conservative, but it's a nice\nround number with existing precedent. Frosthearts are already fairly\nscary as-is, so I've nudged their HD down by 1. This may not turn out to be\nnecessary.\n\nAs for monsters, Frozen was even more sad. Mostly this didn't matter, as\ncircumstances where it was applied to monsters was few (and Upheaval is\nlikely to simply kill them rather than have you worry about how slow they\nmove now). But the combination of 'Almost always lasts 2 turns' and\n'Increases move delay by 4 aut' meant that it was nearly mathematically\nimpossible for a normal-speed enemy to visibly lose even a single turn\nfrom it. (It being a flat +4 to move cost also had the strange effect\nwhere enemies with fast movement but normal overall speed suffered a\ngreater penalty than enemies with equivalently high speed for all actions.)\n\nSince debuffs like this tend to need a *larger* impact to notice on\nmonsters than on players, let's try making it double their move delay\ninstead (and last slightly longer). This will be relevant for the very\nnext commit.",

      "message": "Fix a rare Gozag crash\n\nWhen an enemy is killed in a way that causes their corpse to explode (eg:\nmindburst or iood) while worshipping Gozag, multiple piles of gold are\nscattered around the general area. The amount of gold in each pile is\ndetermined by randomly rounding 'total gold' / 'number of piles'. For\nmedium-sized creatures specifically, if the player rolled the lowest\npossible amount of gold and the highest possible amount of chunks, it was\npossible for this to round down to 0 gold in a pile.\n\nWhich was already specifically guarded against! Piles of 0 gold will not be\nplaced by _explode_corpse. ...but _explode_corpse operates using a\nreference to the 'original' corpse and while place_monster_corpse attempts\nto destroy the corpse item after an explosion, destroy_item() specifically\ndoesn't do anything to an item with a quantity of 0, so the original corpse\n(now gold) would remain with a quantity of 0.\n\nMostly this was invisible, but upon leaving the current floor, attempting\nto save the present floor would trigger an assert for the 0-gold pile being\ninvalid, causing this crash.\n\nNow just make sure that none of the piles ever has less than 0 gold in it.",
