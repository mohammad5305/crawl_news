      "message": "New(?) monster: thermic dynamos, for Elf and vaults elsewhere\n\nThese new monsters are meant to provide another notable nonliving monster\nto Elf beyond the dancing weapons, as well as pick up the fire and ice\ntheme for former crystal bolts much more directly by being bejewelled\nmobile elemental turbines. They're meant to be a weaker glass cannon\ncompared to crystal guardians- swapping their notable AC, rElec+++,\nand a bit of spellpower for passable evasion, fast movement speed, and\ntwo-individually weaker hits of AF_FIRE + AF_COLD. Arguably they're also\na little reminscient of zephyrmancers, as low-AC bolt-bouncers in Elf:\non that front, they're much harder to kill in exchange for a far easier\nresistance and respecting more of AC. In exchange for their overall\nweaker or comparable state they're a bit more common in Elf and various\nvaults than crystal guardians were in V, occasionally banding in duos, and\nalso replace the latter's use in late D.\n\nTo help clarify their particular mechanics and to distance further from the\nold crystal theme, Crystal Bolt spell's dual-element possibilities have\nalso been split into two seperate spells of Rebounding Blaze and Rebounding\nChill, which are slightly-rescaled copies of Bolt of Fire and Bolt of Cold\naside from the wall bounce. I don't know if future uses might be found for\nthese spells or these monsters, but they give a little more variety past\nLair branches in conjunction with the change to V's crystal guardians.\n\nTheir placeholder tile is a mix of DD's old Enter the Abyss tile and\ncanofworms's old tile for the Staff of Battle (before that got orbified).\nThe spell icon tiles, like Crystal Bolt before them, mix together\nroctavian's Bolt of Fire, Bolt of Ice, and stone wall tiles.",

      "message": "C. guardians / echidnas: Crystal Bolt 🡲 Crystalizing Shot (PleasingFungus)\n\nWhile \"notably-resistant melee enemy with a ranged attack\" as an archetype\nfor monsters has a variety of reasonable manifestations as this point,\ncrystal guardians are a bit weird. The earthen theme they might brandish as\na monster made entirely of crystal instead focuses elsewhere, over to the\nconnection crystal walls have with bolts of cold and bolts of fire. That\nparticular mechanic's prominence has been mildly reduced over time, since\nwands lost both and spells lost the former, and there's been a little\nreduction of it versus other forms of it even on monsters (no more deep\nelf conjurers, removed off of necromancers and ancient liches). While it\nlets them fire through some other earthen and icy monsters, it's a bit\noff compared to more direct earth themes of raw damage with a side bit of\ncorrosion at most.\n\nSince Vitrify seems to have worked out relatively well as a dangerous\nhex to throw around, I'm making them fire off a short-range projectile\nshot that applies the status two thirds of the time it hits and deals\nany damage. Refined crystal monster making one as fragile as unrefined\ncrystal has a certain cruel logic to it, and it's one last reasonable\nvector to toss the effect around for a while now by being much more\nthreatening to the high-ac, low-ev characters than Fragile otherwise\npotentially threatens the reverse. It does do less damage on hit than the\ncrystal bolts did, since while it can't bolt-bounce it's inherently\nmultiplicative for other monsters too (like the mighting peacekeeper bands\nin V they show up in most games in, or the terror that Desolation tends to\nbe). To orient them towards their focus on melee here, they also get a few\ntweaks towards slightly less HP and AC but slightly more melee damage.\nThis also gives crystal echidnas the aforementioned Crystallizing Shot over\nCrystal Bolt. They're quite weak for extended and mostly meant to be\ngeneric elemental fodder for Dis, which isn't a terrible position, but as a\nmonster designated only for such late positioning they could do with a\nmechanic of any much note when they're otherwise a faster, weaker version\nof a monster already seen in V. Said vitrification should be terrifying in\nDis, which admittedly might warrant some adjustments on Dis a little later.\n\nThe Crystal Bolt spell hasn't been removed, as a one-off use of\nbolt-bouncing on an element besides lightning is a reasonable mechanical\nniche another monster could use with some renaming. The new Crystallizing\nShot spell tile uses both snw-0's LCS icon and Bloax's Corona icon.",

      "message": "Coglins: --Move, +-Rings & +Resist\n\n-Move was added to Coglins to add tactical variety, and to balance\nout their big upside (dual wielding) without making major and\nundesirable nerfs to skill aptitudes or HP. There were some upsides\nto -Move-on-action, and it might someday return in some other context,\nbut ultimately very few people enjoyed it - even with considerable\nwork put into UI improvements, it still broke flow.\n\nInstead, let's try doubling down on Coglins' 'no fast swap' gimmick\nand remove their ability to wear rings. (It'd interfere with their\nmagic exo-arms, see.) I'm generally not particularly fond of equipment\nrestrictions, since they reduce the fun of finding gear (one of the\njuciest parts of Crawl), but this is at least novel and has some\nother interesting interactions with the rest of the species.\n\nTo partially compensate for this downside later on, Coglins now gain\nrF+ rC+ at XL 13. We might or might not eventually replace this with\na choice between a few different 'upgrades'.\n\nMinor notes:\n- Coglins can still wear rings if they find the Macabre Finger\n  Necklace. This is very silly and the UI isn't great, but unrands\n  are allowed to be silly.\n- Possibly we should remove rings from the % screen rather than\n  showing them as 'unavailable'.",

Clouds on top of the player are also probably\nless nice decoratively while being more obstructive functionally (e.g.\nthey block catoblepas breath), so let's just only place them adjacent\nto the player.\n\n(This commit also removes a small chance of not getting any cloud even\nwhen there is still room adjacent to the player.)",

      "message": "feat: Simplify formulas for artefact properties (elliptic)\n\nWhen making an item randart, there's a binomial(7, 0.3) distribution\nused to assign quality from a level of 1 to 7. This is currently done by\ntaking a binomial with 7 trials and taking a max of this and 1. This\ncommit simplifies this to just be a 1 + binomial(6, 0.21), which has a\nsimilar mean.\n\nAdditionally this commit simplifies the distribution for the number of\nbad artefact properties added. The current implementation is a min of a\nbinomial distribution and the max allowed bad properties, which is 2\nminus the number of any fixed bad properties. This binomial has a number\nof trials randomized based on the quality level and random rounding,\nwith a fixed `p` of 0.3. The new implementation removes the min and the\ndependence on quality in the binomial, making the number of trials\nsimply be the max allowed bad properties. The `p` is reduced to 0.21 to\nkeep the mean number of bad properties similar to as before.\n\nThis distribution will lead to more randarts having only 1 bad property\ninstead of 2 and will even out the numbers of bad properties across\nrandarts by quality. It's not clear that the original relationship of\nbad props to quality was necessary and this new distribution is much\neasier to reason about.\n\nHere are stats for `any randart` from 10k iterations each both before\nand after this distribution change:\n\nBefore:\nMax # of props = 6, mean =  2.87, median = 3\nMax # of good props = 5, mean =  2.45, median = 2\nMax # of bad props = 2, mean =  0.42, median = 0\nMax (good - bad) props = 5, avg # =  2.03\n\nAfter:\nMax # of props = 6, mean =  2.97, median = 3\nMax # of good props = 6, mean =  2.54, median = 3\nMax # of bad props = 2, mean =  0.44, median = 0\nMax (good - bad) props = 6, avg # =  2.10\n\nThe means are quite similar for both types of props, so this change\nshouldn't have a large effect, but will make future reasoning about\nrandart balance easier.",

      "message": "feat: Rework wizmode artefact and randart stats\n\nThis commit improves a number of aspects of the Ctrl-I wizmode command\nthat generates statistics for acquirement and randarts. The randart\nstats subcommand now accepts an arbitrary item spec instead of prompting\nfor an inventory item. This allows us to examine randart stats of\narbitrary item classes that can create multiple types of items, as well\nas stats for randarts that use the newly implemented fixed properties.\n\nThis subcommand now prompts for a number of iterations instead of always\nmaking ~27k. Despite doing a bit more work in item generation, it still\nruns quickly enough to generate statistics for 10k items in a few\nseconds on my machine. The item spec used forces randart, but for item\nspecs that can generate non-randart items (e.g. `any` can generate\nconsumables), such items are discarded and not used in the statistics.\n\nThe subcommands now write to the distinct files \"acquirement_stats.txt\"\nand \"randart_stats.txt\" instead of using the same \".stats\" file. Output\nfile creation now happens only after all input is validated and output\nprogress is simplified. For both subcommands, item creation happens at\nthe unseen origin location (0,0), eliminating message spam. Finally, the\nsubcommands are refactored to use central data accessors for artefact\nproperties, egos, etc, instead of maintaining their own independent\nlists.",

The values are given in any item spec\naccording to the following syntax:\n\nartprops:prop1:val1&prop2:val2 ...\n\nMatches against property names are case insensitive, and properties like\nrPois and ^Contam that are boolean can omit specifying the value. This\nsyntax can be used in any item spec, including when defining items for\nvaults, giving items to monsters, etc.\n\nWhen making the item, the randart property randomization considers the\nfixed values in terms never overriding these values. Randart generation\nconsiders how many good/bad properties the fixed ones add to the item\nand proceeds with its usual randomization process, which means that it\nmay add additional random properties.\n\nSome error checking is done on the given value ranges to prevent\nnegative values on properties that are only ever positive and to only\nallow 0 or 1 on boolean values.",

Each Dismiss Apostle ability will also show the same stat place for\nthe apostle you're dismissing.\n\nThis block shows name, class, HP/AC/Damage, equipment, and spells. It's\ngenerally much less featureful than xv, but should still be a meaningful\nUI improvement. Additional polish may come in future, but I felt that this\nalready provides enough QoL benefit that it's worth pushing.",

Try a similar dynamic with -Move\non attack/cast/throw, lasting for your turn + 1 normal action.\n\nThis is pretty similar in terms of tactical implications, since\nmoving at 2.0 speed is similar to waiting for 1.0 and then moving at\n1.0. The upside is that this blocks dangerous moves; the downside is\nthat it involves more obstruction from and messaging by the UI.\n\nLet's try it out. :)",

      "message": "New decorations: caches of fruit and meat\n\nThese are meant to provide the flavour of fruit trees and groves, or people\ndiscreting stashing away meals within settlements and fortresses, without\nthe attending manifold issues of the hunger clock. Many vaults on either\nfront end up involving the constant presence of greenery or lakes and moats\nto emphasize the notions of housing; this can compliment and reduce the use\nof either without interrupting as plants and water do, with relatively\nstraightforward decoration that shouldn't be confusable as much else.\n\nBoth of these fruit and meat piles are akin to dry fountains, not statues-\nthey don't block fire or movement, and solely sit on the ground. They can\nalso walked on without any effects beyond a rare message about stopping\nto nibble at floor food. (Most of the fruit messages are trying to be\ncosmopolitan, while the meat messages this time around are specifically\ntailored to the various animals of the Dungeon for a little more\nworld-building. There's also a variety of species-specific messages.)\nIn console, these are green and brown % or ÷ glyphs, the same glyphs as\nskeletons, which should continue to help with not flooding the screen any\nmore than those currently do.\n\n(This also comes with a couple vaults being scaled for further locations\nthan they currently possess, since they felt workable for other contexts.)\n\nThe current fruit cache tile was made by snw-0, while the meat cache tile\ncomponents go as far back as the original rltiles project. They're a little\nplaceholdery- they feel a bit too item-like for now, though players\nshouldn't take too long to get used to it. These, more than any other\ndecorative feature, would benefit from more contributions over time-\ngetting back sultanas, snozzcumbers, and pizza would be nice, and it would\nalso help to drift away from tiles that specifically invoke old carryable\nitems. I'd also be up for a cache of baked goods for a handful of vaults,\nwhich could easily have some pie pile tiles for Zot....\n\n(TODO: .rc setting for allowing fully muting the new MSGCH_DECOR_FLAVOUR,\nor brightening it from a current default darkgray. If such controls get in,\nmaybe we could consider rare messages for other stuff, like walking over\nfountains, beside animated statues, or on top of impending cloud vents?)",
