With walking earthen tomes often casting it many times in a\nsingle turn, it was very possible to get instantly petrified with no\nrecourse.\n\nThis commit removes that behavior for both monsters and players (it wasn't\neven documented in-game, to my knowledge!).\n\nAt the same time, it attempts to give a consistent 30 aut to respond to\nbeginning to petrify (rather than it depending somewhat unintuitively on\nhow slow youe previous action was). This meant that while the player could\nusually perform 2 normal speed actions before petrifying, sometimes they\ncould not (which could be very unexpected).\n\nFinally, spellpower of the monster petrify spell is increased somewhat in\ncompensation, as well as the chance for clouds of calcifying dust to\npetrify the player.",

      "message": "Adjust various timing issues with Paralysis (Acrobat), and tweak Vex\n\nThe way paralysis timing was handled internally had some wierd and\nunintuitive interactions with minipara in particular. While theoretically\nintended as a 1-turn paralysis, if it happened to the player while they\nwere taking a 10 aut (or longer) action, it you wouldn't actually cause\nthem to lose any time at all! But if the action was faster than that, they\nwould in fact lose 10 aut. (ie: Moving and getting minipared = 10 aut,\nAttacking at 0.7 delay and getting miniparaed = 17 aut). This meant that\nin many 1v1 situations, minipara might have literally no effect besides\nlooking very scary.\n\nThis situation is a result of two things:\n a) While stunned by any means, the player passed time in 10 aut\n    increments (meaning 1 aut of remaining paralysis will still consume 10\n    aut)\n b) Paralysis loses duration at the *start* of the player turn (meaning it\n    will immediately lose duration equal to the speed of the previous\n    action).\n\n(a) is easy to fix - we now pass time in 10 aut increments while stunned,\nunless the remaining stun time is less than 10 aut, in which case we pass\nonly that much time.\n\n(b) is a bit harder. Ignoring the turn spent becoming paralysed would make\nfull paralysis while slowed/statue significantly worse that is right now.\n\nHowever minipara should do *something*, so I am opting for all player\nparalysis to last 5 aut more than previously (along with not always\nrounding to 10 aut intervals on decay). Considering players spend a lot of\ntime attacking things at faster speeds than 1.0 (for which this will often\nreduce duration slightly), this isn't a strict buff to the effect, but\nshould hopefully make it slightly more consistent - particularly for\nminipara.\n\nIn addition, this rewrites some very old logic that technically allowed\nparalysis from god wrath to stack in duration with other sources (except\nin ways that could sometimes resulted in *reducing* how paralysed you are\ninstead.) This is too niche to be concerned with, and now they simply won't\nattempt to paralyse you if it wouldn't work.\n\n(This will result in a minor bug in upgraded saves where the notes for\nparalysis from prior to this commit will display their durations divided by\n10. I decided this wasn't worth the save compat code.)\n\nFinally, this makes a modest chage to Vex behavior. Instead of the player\nattacking at 1.0 speed no matter what, they will attack with their normal\nattack delay (and if there isn't enough aut left at the end of the effect\nfor another attack, simply pass the remaining time.)",

      "message": "Give dispersal traps a short cooldown (and fix a bug)\n\nWhile dispersal traps have an interesting effect that can rapidly\nrecontextualize combat, there are many scenarios where - once they are\nfirst triggered - it becomes impossible to prevent monsters from rapidly\nretriggering it for many turns in a row, making combat overly chaotic and\nuncontrollable. This can be especially true in parts of Tomb, with its\nconfined spaces and swarms of batty death scarabs.\n\nNow, each time a given dispersal trap activates, it goes dormant for 4-7\nturns, during which it will not trigger at all. This should be often enough\nto remain very relevant without leading to situations where the positions\nof everything get randomized constantly.\n\nAt the same time, this commit fixes another bug where monsters were blinked\nby dispersal traps in expanding radius order, which could lead to the same\nmonster being potentially blinked many times (ie: a monster close to the\ntrap would be blinked slightly further away, then be found again as the\niteration continued, blinked again, etc.) This was functionally fairly\nsimilar to blinking each monster once, but tended to produce more clouds,\nmore messages, (and probably had a slightly higher chance of blinking\nmonsters out of LoS entirely). Now it should blink each monster exactly\nonce.",

That is, any precision in the value of a marshalled\nnumeric lua value would be removed, since the value is cast to integer.\nIn the conversion to lua 5.4, the map marker marshalling code wasn't\nupdated to push the unmarshalled value as an integer lua value and now\nalways pushes a floating point one.\n\nGoing forward, we should either have a scheme for marshalling lua\nnumeric types properly or at least error when a caller attempts to\nmarshall a numerica lua value that's actually floating point. The former\nprobably involves having every instance of lua marshalling use\nfile.marshall_meta() and using the same floating point/int union kludge\nwe use for marshalling/unmarshalling float values elsewhere in save\nfiles. Since there are no cases of attempted marshalling of non-integer\nnumeric values in the current lua marker code that I can see, maybe just\nadding checks/errors is the best approach for now.",

For example, if reading\n?fog created enough clouds to immediately break LoS with a beholder,\nmesmerisation would end. But if they did so via spreading later on (in\nmanage_clouds()), LoS would often still appear to be immediately obscured\nto the player, but mesmerisation would *not* end.\n\nNow in addition to checking at the end of the player's turn, we also check\nat its start, which should fix these issues.",

      "message": "Upgrade monster Repel Missiles to Deflect Missiles\n\nWhile monster repel missiles did reduce incoming damage, it often didn't\ndo so by enough that a player felt motivated to deviate from their primary\nstrategy - even if that strategy was firing missiles. In many realistic\ncases, it was worth less than one pip of a resistance (despite being much\nrarer than those).\n\nThis boosts its effect from +15 EV to +24 EV, making it closer to a 50%\ndamage reduction against average monsters and further than that for evasive\nones. hellmonk felt it should also be renamed if it was going to be\nstronger than the player effect, so now it is.\n\nA few monster changes were made in compensation for this:\n -Sojobo and spriggan air mages lose a little EV\n -Nekomata lose repel missiles entirely, without replacement. (They're\n  scary enough as it is!)\n\n(Enchantress is realistically virtually missile-immune at this point, but\nher defenses have always been very polarizing and I think it's fine if\nalternate strategies are strictly required.)",

      "message": "Buff Injury Bond, nerf Marytr's Knell in compensation\n\nWhen used by most monsters, Injury Bond tends not to play especially\ninterestingly. Since you still inflict just as much total damage (just\nsplit between two people), unless one target is especially high priority,\nthere isn't any particular impetus to play differently than otherwise.\nPreserver bands in particular tend to be fairly homogeneous in threat, so\nit doesn't really matter who you're hitting. And when used by orc apostles,\nit may be actively negative (by concentrating more damage on one apostle,\nwho might then die when they otherwise would not have).\n\nSo instead of the caster taking the full brunt of the redirected damage,\nlet's have them take only 50% instead (ie: 100 damage dealt -> 50 to the\noriginal target and 25 to the Injury Bond caster). This will make it more\nefficient to actually take out a preserver first in some cases and\nhopefully make it play better on apostles.\n\nHowever, Martyr's Knell already made good use of the effect as it was, and\nI don't want to wildly increase its effectiveness, so I am reducing the\nshade's health and regen significantly. And then since that would *also*\nmake it much easier to convert into a flayed ghost off direct damage, am\nincreasing its defenses. This is hopefully at least roughly in the ballpark\nof its present power.",

      "message": "Fix issue with allied monster sidestepping and tweak\n\nThe code which handled making monsters sometimes sidestep in melee to allow\nranged monsters behind them to attack the player had 2 bugs since 7ec163d.\n\nThe first was considering a monster blocked so long as its threat range\ncould *reach* them, rather than reach *past* them (which would be required\nfor them to hit something else.) Notably, this could result in things\nrepeatedly dancing in circles to try and get out of the way of the melee\nattacks of monsters behind them.\n\nThe second was inverted logic in the genus check; it was intended that\nhostile monsters only sideside for same-genus monsters, while friendly\nmonsters could sidestep for anything. The inverse was happening.\n\nHowever, I have also decided that this genus check is opaque and silly;\nlots of intelligent monsters clearly on the same faction do not belong to\nthe same genus. Should a vault warden be so heedless of the yaktaurs in\ntheir very own band? Should a beastmaster ignore their own beasts? The\nonly demon genuses shared by more than one monster are 'hell lord' and\n'pandemonium lord'.\n\nInstead, all intelligent monsters will be willing to sidestep for ranged\nallies, with one caveat: they will avoid doing this for their own summoner\n(if applicable), since this tends to help the player instead.\n\nIn keeping with this, the separate check that causes sidestepping to allow\nadjacent allies through when there is no other path around them is *also*\nloosened for intelligent monsters, who will try to let anything else past\nin chokepoints.",

      "message": "New maces brand: Concussion\n\nThis brand causes all of the wielder's hits to push their victim backwards\nand then follow them if they were the primary target of the attack (which\nis to say that things like WJC whirlwind and Xom cleave status won't move\nyou in random directions, but still push things away).\n\nMonsters displaced this way suffer a ministun proportional to your attack\ndelay (so finessed whips can't stunlock things), while those unable to\nmove because of a solid feature at their back will be crushed against it\nand take +~25% damage instead. This gives the player a solid direct offense\nboost based on positioning, as well as the ability to better-maneuver\nenemies to take advantage of this. (And in cases where it is safe and\nviable to shove an enemy across the floor, you can get a defensive benefit\nfor doing so.) WJC also opens up interesting possibilities with whirlwind\nopening up space and lunges quickly isolating monsters from their allies.\n\n(The player cannot be ministunned from being hit by this, but super-trample\ncan obviously be very disruptive to their positioning.)\n\n(Brand icon made by regret-index, editing a CC0 weapon icon made by Shade)",

      "message": "New axes brand: Sundering\n\nThis brand causes each consecutive melee attack to store up power,\neventually unleashing it in a single massive attack that does triple its\nnormal damage, is more accurate, and cleaves with +1 reach. But this\nrequires 6 attacks performed in a row, without any other actions inbetween\nor the count will be reset. This makes its average sustained damage higher\nthan most brands (especially if the extra reach matters), but also less\nflexible. Very natural synergy with WJC, of course!\n\nSince monsters that have anything else they could do besides attack will\nnever realistically attack 6 times in a row, it works slightly differently\non them: it takes only 4 attacks (though hits a little less hard), but the\nonly thing they are forbidden from doing is *moving*. This allows the\nplayer some counterplay to keep a monster from sundering them, by refusing\nto stand in place and let them. (Monsters also get an icon over their head\nto indicate their sunder is charged).\n\n(Sundering icon and vfx made by regret-index, using a CC0 weapon icon made\nby Shade and a CC0 slash effect by Cethiel.)",

      "message": "Refactor handling of monster attack rounds\n\nWhile melee_attack::launch_attack_set() handled players making multiple\nattacks in one round (eg: coglins), it did not do this for monsters.\nInstead, fight_melee() would construct one melee_attack per attack that a\nmonster has and call attack() on each one. But this meant both that any\nattempt to make a monster attack *outside* of fight_melee() would only ever\nuse their first attack, and that it was impossible to apply special attack\nproperties to a monster's full attack round.\n\nAs practical consequences of this, Vhi's Electrolunge, any attacks a\nmonster made while Vexed, and Manifold Assault could only ever use the\nfirst attack a monster had - just one weapon or one hydra head, etc.\nBy handling the full attack set inside melee_attack instead, these (and\nfuture special attacks) can all work more properly.\n\nThere is one nit in that Manifold Assault still ends up being slightly\nasymmetric with the player spell (just in a different way). Player auxes\nnever happen on projected attacks, but monsters don't define 'aux' as\ndistinct from any other attack. We can't rely just on it being a weapon\nattack, since the 'primary' attack type for many monsters is something else\n(eg: Bite or Claw). In interest of simplicity, I am accepting that monsters\nwith Manifold Assault can simply use all of their attacks.",

      "message": "Refactor how many post-attack player effects are handled\n\nThere were a variety of effects that could happen after each\n'attack action' the player performed (rather than each separate attack()\ncall, so that things like quick blades and coglins did not cause them to\nhappen far more rapidly, and projected attacks like Manifold Assault did\nnot cause them to happen at all). This included Platinum Paragon's followup\nattack, Dith shadow mimic melee, as well as duration extensions for effects\nlike Detonation Catalyst and Werefury that are supposed to be maintained\nso long as the player attacks.\n\nHowever, there were a variety of inconsistencies. Several things that could\nlogically be considered an 'attack action' did none of these (such as Vhi's\nor oni potion cleave). Manifold Assault extended exactly Detonation\nCatalyst and no other enchantments. And it was still possible to sometimes\ntrigger these post-attack effects multiple times in one action anyway (for\ninstance via Lunge+Rampage (even though Lunge+Whirlwind still only counted\nas one)), which could result in net duration gain on detonation catalyst\nand similar effects. Coglin Rev also used a probabilistic chance of revving\nup for martial attacks, which could result in revving many times in one\nturn (or failing to rev at all).\n\nThis attempts to standadize behavior a little more, as well as make it\nharder to overlook actions which should trigger it:\n\n-Shadow mimic, paragon followup, solar flare, coglin rev, and medusa\n tendrils now can trigger at most once per player turn (no matter how many\n trigger actions might happen on that turn).\n\n-Durations that are intended not to decay so long as the player attacks can\n now be indicated with a D_ATTACK_EXTENDED flag and will automatically not\n decay on any turn an attack was attempted against hostile non-firewood.\n (Where 'attempted' now includes failed attacks due to fumbling in water,\n fear, failing to reach past an ally with a reaching weapon, or failing to\n perform martial attacks due to moving too fast.)\n\n-Vhi's Electric Charge, Bestial Takedown, spellclaws, spellmotor, and oni\n potion cleave can now trigger follow-up attacks. Manifold Assault cannot\n (but will still sustain M_ATTACK_EXTENDED durations). Ripostes do neither.\n The rule is, essentially, that only 'direct' attacks cause post-attack\n effects, and 'bonus' attacks not due to any player action (ie: riposte)\n do not count as an attempted attack by the player (in the same spirit as\n them already not affecting Acrobat status).\n\n-Berserk non-attack penalty tracking and coglin rev are now folded into the\n same function as other post-attack effects, for more centralized handling.\n\n-All of this is normally handled automatically by\n melee_attack::launch_attack_set(), but in cases where a single attack\n action consists of multiple melee_attacks, launch_attack_set(true) should\n be called and then player_attempted_attack() called manually afterward.\n\nThis should hopefully make behavior more consistent and also easier to work\nwith for various future things.",

      "message": "Clarify the semantics of multiple attack methods\n\nThe attack class had many methods which returned bool, but whose return\nvalue was never checked. In several of these cases, those methods always\nreturned the same value anyway (though not all of them). I think it was\noriginally intended to be 'return false if combat should stop at this\npoint', but even this wasn't respected in practice.\n\nOn top of this, the attack() method itself had odd semantics, where it\nreturned true only if an attack was 'fully completed' and did not abort\nearly, but this 'abort early' value was interpreted elsewhere as 'attack\ndid not actually occur', resulting in numerous oddnesses. For instance,\nThroatcutter's instakill effect, or landing any killing blow with Wyrmbane\n(whether on a dragon or not!) would prevent Dith shadow mimics or platinum\nparagons from responding to that attack, since it looked from the outside\nthe same as a fumble.\n\nNow all methods that returned bool without this being meaningfully used\nreturn void instead. And attack() itself should more consistently return\nfalse only if an attack (as well as any cleaving/multi-hit followups it\nmight have) all outright fail, due to fumbling, fear, lack of valid\ntargets, etc. But so long as you actually swing at anything, it should\nreturn true.\n\n(This also fixes a bug where cleaving and multi-hit attacks would report\nthat they did twice as much damage in total as they actually did. The only\ncurrent effect of this is that Enkindled spellclaw attacks with such\nweapons would heal twice as much as intended.)",
