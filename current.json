      "message": "Reset lua state properly for objstat/mapstat\n\nSimilar to d744bac7, we now reset lua states and subsequently reload the\nnecessary data after each iteration. This fixes a problem where large\nobjstat jobs (e.g. 1000 iterations of generating all of the Dungeon\nbranch) eventually error repeatedly in zonify layout code. The precise\nreason for this hasn't been fully debugged, but it seems to be related\nto available lua memory. For now, it's wise to follow the same close ->\nreinitialize procedure as we do for the main game loop in each\nobjstat/mapstat iteration.\n\nTesting has shown that this reset doesn't significantly impact objstat\nperformance. In the future, when I rework game loop lua reinitializaiton\nto more carefully reset and load only the necessary data, we can revisit\nneeded to close and reopen the lua state for all game modes.",

      "message": "Adjust morphogenic ooze slimification accumulation\n\nWhile the original af_slimify timing was roughly based off of bat cloud\ndrowinsess numbers, clouds are much more consistent at applying their\neffects than attack brands are in combat. It's very plausible to be killed\nby a morphogenic ooze band well before one actually gets slimified in the\nfirst place, due to each turn where an ooze fails to hit allows one to\nwork off the effect build-up without really bothering with any\ncounterplay, since each hit only applies 35-45 aut of a status that needs\nto reach 100 to activate that also goes down 10 each turn. Rather than\nmaking them apply the status in one or two hits entirely, I am doubling\nthe status application and threshold numbers both, which thus halves the\nrate the status wears off mid-fight. As rare monsters with a singular\ngimmick far less instantly lethal than other summoning or conjurations\nmechanics added to the branch this version, we might as well test a\nversion of the monster with a functional version of the gimmick first.\n\n(This commit also adjusts the colour schema of DUR_SLIMIFYING to reduce\nthe ambiguity of going across multiple shades of magenta. No save-compat\ncode has been included with this commit, as there is rather little benefit\nin tactically converting an older save mid-fight to try and prevent\nslimification against exactly one encounter. I am also fixing a notable\nbug where one could cancel jelly form immediately after actually getting\nit, which I hope hasn't been distorting the testing of the monster\nentirely....)",

Heavily adjusted\nthe latter vault to scale substantially more with depth rather than just\nthrowing slime creatures on D:3 at newcomers, completely revised the\nvisuals to both emphasize Zin sealing the god and to use tiles customized\nper-god rather than using Tartarus stone for Jiyva and Lugonu, and adjusted\nthe weight of both the vault and its chance to just roll Xom over Jiyva\nand Lugonu so it doesn't have to be hyper-rare in its placement.\n\nCloses #4998.]",

      "message": "Tweak worldbinder summons once more\n\nWhen ugly things and very ugly things stopped spawning in V as of f517b90,\nworldbinder summons weren't adjusted in exchange, so they still declared\nthemselves summoning ugly things from the Vaults. As V-convoking\nworldbinders are still notably the strongest of worldbinders despite the\nremoval of thunderhulks from their list in 3be09a1, this could still do\nwith further adjustments.\n\nWorldbinders summoning from The Vaults now get polterguardians and\nironbound preservers, rather than very ugly things and ironbound\nfrosthearts. This should be reasonably distinct for a summoner's summons\neven more directly helping its own summoner's lifespan, and not feature\nquite as much spikes of resist checkecs as the previous ones.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm also trading away the Shoals' set's manticores and merfolk\naquamancers for merfolk sirens and water nymphs, which should be less\nboring as support monsters compared to the projectile conjuration effects\nstruggling to entirely function in the Abyss's terrain pressures. Both of\nthese have some of the worst-performing worldbinder summons in terms of\nkill stats (and aquamancers also feel pretty high tier in their own\nbranch), so this should continue to nudge the total worldbinder threat\npools closer together.",

This should\nstill provide a bit of a tangible edge to rolling it with only a few\nmutations or getting past the soft cap ceiling via mutation gods, while\nstill preventing the mutation gods from having a mutation that just flatly\nprovides +10 to +20 double stat benefits.",

This was\ncaused by a call to `tile_new_level` after the call to `load_level`\nin `_wizard_go_to_level` setting all the tiles in the tile cache to\nTILE_DNGN_UNSEEN. This call to `tile_new_level` isn't even needed\nanymore as commit ef9621c added a call to it to `load_level`\n(Technically the functions were `TileNewLevel` and `load` back then).\nThe call to `tile_new_level` in `load_level` happens before automapping\nthe level so it doesn't cause this problem.",

If it specified a tile with a colour e.g.\nfloor_rough_blue it would get the tile in the colour specified. This\nlet us use the console colour for tiles with animated colours as these\ncan't be specified directly (e.g. there is no floor_rough_etc_random for\na random animated colour) while still letting tiles use a different\ncolour from console when it looks better.\n\nHowever, some coloured tiles are just aliases for the non-coloured\nversion e.g. floor_rough_red is an alias for floor_rough so if a vault\nspecified a floor as having the tile floor_rough_red it would actually\nget the tile floor_rough in whatever colour console used for floors.\n\nTo fix this, only apply animated console colours to floor and rock wall\ntiles. This is actually what we did prier to commit 6dfb6d6 but it was\nlost in the rework.",

This also adds additional tiles for naga, armataur,\n   and djinn all avoiding the barding-slot area for the former two.\n\n * Dragon-coil talismans now have shadows (for e.g. Shoals), as was\n   accidentally left out of providing the new tile in c257eed.\n\n * The hive-form felid tile has now been flipped to match other felid\n   transformation tiles.\n\n * The werewolf felid tile now uses part of LemurRobot's vampire felid\n   tile, as the head from Denzi's cats had poor proportions in comparison.\n\n * Orbs of mayhem now use the frenzied icon from eedf646 instead of the\n   droplet of blood that e.g. vampric weapons use.\n\n * I've adjusted ontoclasm's Death's Door icon to actually bleed past the\n   spell icon frame to match the other level 9 spells doing the same, as\n   was neglected back in 8d63b16.\n\n * Monster Deflect Missiles now once more uses ontoclasm's old Deflect\n   Missiles icon, to both reflect the older use of the name and to have a\n   somewhat more dramatic icon for a now stronger effect.\n\n * Planar Overlay now has a new tile made from ontoclasm's Passage of\n   Golubria tile instead of just directly using that same tile.\n\n * The plainest of the Depths stone wall tiles now has slightly more\n   decoration on it to help it match more with the rest of its set.\n\n * Detected decorative floor tiles use a less bright lower-contrast tile\n   to be less gaudy when detecting them in large masses (e.g. with the\n   current arrangement for weapon-inlaid floor in Elf:2's Hall of Blades).",

These aren't getting a lot of distribution quite yet (between\nthe impending feature freeze and their narrowed flavour), but the lua and\ndescriptions have been set up for these vaults, with the write-ups also\nmostly written by Darby.",

The Tab key performs the same function as ! here, but does\r\nnot require shift -- even more critically, Shift+Tab will navigate the\r\nspell library backwards. Along with being slightly more conveniently\r\nplaced than !, the Tab key may encourage more active use of hiding and\r\nshowing spells, as well as the auto_hide_spells option.",

      "message": "Fix some issues with invalid pet_target and allies\n\nPreviously, if the player's pet_target was set to a monster that was, for\nsome reason, no longer a valid target for your allies (often due to being\nout of LoS, but potentially for several other reasons), we would still set\nis as their foe and then later on reset their foe to MHITNOT.\n\nThis manifested in a couple of negative ways. Running from a fight with a\ndead ancestor could make the ancestor respawn wandering (since it is trying\nto fight a now-distant monster and cannot) and newly-summoned allies would\nsometimes stand around doing nothing if you had a 'leftover' pet target\nfrom a previous battle.\n\nNow we test pet_target validity before assining it to allies. In cases\nwhere the pet_target is invalid for them, we use the same auto-targeting\nbehavior we would use if there was no pet_target at all (ie: engage the\nnearest visible enemy).\n\n[Commiter's note: restructured some logic to be more consistent with\ntypical DCSS formatting, put in a check for a possible array out-of-bounds\nand rewrote the commit message/name for clarity.]",

      "message": "Fix mouse clicks sometimes not working for Yes/No prompts on local tiles\n\nA bug was causing mouse clicks on yes/no popups to be ignored on Windows.\nRoot cause: negative mouse keycodes (for example CK_MOUSE_B1 == -9997) were\nsometimes passed to C library character functions (such as\nisalpha/toupper). Those functions are defined only for EOF or values\nrepresentable as unsigned char; passing negative non-EOF values invokes\nundefined behaviour and corrupted the prompt logic. The fix replaces use of\nthe C library character test with the project’s ASCII-only helper\nisaalpha() when checking popup input. Using isaalpha() avoids invoking\nundefined behaviour on negative keycodes and ensures mouse clicks are\ncorrectly accepted.\n\nThis change only replaces the character test; no other logic was changed.\n\nThis hopefully fixes #4968, fixes #4590, fixes #4090, and fixes #3074\n\n[Committer's note: included PR description into the commit message and\nnoted issue fixes. I hadn't been able to reproduce the original bug on my\nend, but the logic seems sound, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.]",

The\n   Bailey fortress talisman chance remains 10%, but also gets a 5% chance\n   to place blade talismans as well (as are now weapon skill agnostic).\n\n * Some talismans distributed by tier have been juggled around to\n   accomodate the new eel and spore talismans plus the blade talisman\n   nudge upwards. The talismans have also been distributed around a\n   small bit, with spore talismans in particular leaning a bit towards\n   decorative fungus vaults with the lack of general plant enemies\n   earlier on, and eel talismans unsurprisingly placing in water heavy\n   vaults.\n\n * A ranged weapons check has been added to troves to deal with various\n   brands (like spectral and reaping) being incompatible with those\n   weapons. As such, for characters with more ranged weapons skill than\n   any other weapon skill, Eringya's Secret Bog provides longbows (as are\n   loosely appropriate for that wooded marsh) and The Dread Knight's\n   Derelict Chapel simply just focuses on draining ranged weapons.\n\n * Rutra's Hidden Sanctum (the Hexes and Stealth trove) no longer\n   generates for characters who have less than 1 Stealth skill.\n\n * Other Trove item improvements include providing troll leather armour\n   randarts whenever one would previously get normal leather randarts,\n   one more spell in each book, slightly more manuals than previously,\n   some slightly higher consumable stacks for many different items,\n   enhancer auxes properly managed fore the The Name-Rending Infernalists'\n   Reservoir and Ozocubu's Refridgerator, more Strength n randarts in\n   Leda's Sunken Stockpile, and slightly higher odds to get the Octopus\n   King's Garden as is the main jewellery trove.\n\n * I've fit in a single new custom shop vault, finally providing an\n   air-themed shop to parallel the earth-themed shop added 13 years ago,\n   also meant to help slightly increase the amount of eel talismans\n   available per game.\n\n * wall_brick_lightred has had its colours slightly tweaked down towards\n   reasonability while it is currently buggily in Bailies, just in case\n   it ends up being used in other vaults anyway.",

      "message": "Buff vampire form\n\nGenerally considered to be a little underperforming (even if fun), this\ncommit adds a new property to help their stealth gameplay in a unique way:\nwhen living/demonic/holy monsters first notice a player in vampire form,\nthey have a 75% chance to be momentarily dazed - skipping their turn and,\nimportantly, preventing them from shouting. If they fail a Will check, they\nwill be dazed for several turns longer.\n\nThis improves a vampire's ability to stab (and thus interact with other\nparts of their kit) in a way that stealth alone could not - even while some\nmonsters are aware of you, their bandmates may still be sleeping and ripe\nto turn to your side.\n\nIn addition, some changes have been made to their Bat Swarm ability:\n -The transformation is no longer uncancellable, so the player can manually\n  leave it early in order to stab a monster who has been put to sleep.\n  (I deliberately disallowed this in the original design since I felt it\n  would make the ability primarily an offensive tool rather than an escape\n  option. However, given the XP recharge involved, it may be okay to allow\n  this.)\n -The amount of clouds created no longer scales with shapeshifting skill.\n  In general, less will be made immediately and they will have a shorter\n  duration, but they will be generated more rapidly while remaining in the\n  form.\n -The XP cooldown is now shortened by shapeshifting skill (though it is\n  somewhat slower at 17 skill than previously).\n\nThe chance of performing a vampiric attack while at low health also no\nlonger scales with shapeshifting skill and is always 66%.\n\nI realize that vampire form already had a lot going on and this introduces\na new mechanic on top of that, but it was hard to figure out what to prune\nfrom it due to how they are all so thematically connected to the identity\nof 'being a vampire' or work specifically in combination with each other.\n(And several players specifically requested that the thrall mechanics be\nkept in any rework of it.) Hopefully it dovetails smoothly enough into the\nrest of what the form does that the complexity it adds isn't excessive.",

      "message": "New protean form: Spore\n\nReplacing Maw's old slot as a tier 2 form obtainable from a protean\ntalisman, this form transforms one arm into a mass of rapidly-growing\nfungus. It melds offhand and boots, gives your melee attacks a 50% chance\nto weaken any breathing monster on hit, and also grows a line of 3\nburstshrooms directly behind what you hit. These burstshrooms are\nstationary monsters with relatively low HP, but if allowed to live for\nseveral turns, self-destruct in a burst of spores that deals moderate\ndamage and has a small chance of dazing enemies hit (and ignores allies\nentirely).\n\nThey provides a multi-purpose tool which can be used as both an\nobstruction and a damage source, in the proper terrain, potentially\nsplitting bands apart and delaying enemy reinforcements through a\ncombination of their bodies and any daze they might inflict. WJC\nworshippers can deploy these mushrooms even more flexibly and\nFedhas-worshippers can shoot through them.\n\nIt should hopefully be a more exciting roll than Maw was on a shapeshifter\nstart (while also not having the awkward property of being better later in\nthe game).\n\n--------------------------\n\nSpore form player doll, talismans, and burstshroom tiles were made by\nregret-index, using CC0 fungi units made by Blarumyrran, CC0 mushroom dogs\ncommissioned by Screen Smith Studios released to the public domain, and\nCC0 robot assets made by Emcee Flesher. The felid form tile combines each\nof these with the statue felid tile made by Sastreii and the vampire felid\ntile made by LemurRobot.",

      "message": "Replace Blade Hands with Eel Hands, rework Blade talisman for 17 skill\n\nBlade hands was left largely untouched by 0.33's talisman changes (meaning\nlargely unchanged since many versions before that). It may not have seemed\nparticularly bad on paper, but given its relatively low rate of use, I\nthink that what it offered (ie: 'higher single-target UC damage in\nexchange for worse defenses') was not really what most UC characters in\nmidgame were looking for. When it was a form a background started with,\nthis was less true, but there are good odds of a player having access to a\nmultitude of other more appealing forms by the time they find a blade\ntalisman.\n\nSo this commit adds a new form to replace its position of 'mid-tier\nUC-only talisman that melds few slots' while repurposing the talisman's\ntheme for a replacement to Maw's old role as 'quick blade aux synergy' at\nan even higher tier.\n\nBlade form (now 17 min skill) now causes blades to grow out of many\n*other* parts of one's body instead of their hands, providing a pair of\nmoderate damage auxes and also a parrying bonus (like the glove ego) that\nis directly increased by any source of slaying one has. It retains the\nbase body AC penalty the form currently has. This should be stronger in\nits role of 'turn a quick blade into a blender' than maw form currently\nis, but hopefully better-balanced by taking more skill to attain\n(especially when combined with the quick blade mindelay change). (It might\nalso make the high blade talisman chance in the Hall of Blades actually\nmatter to anyone...)\n\nAnd at 12 min skill there is Eel Hands, which is... approximately what it\nsays on the tin. This melds the same things that blade hands did, provides\nrElec, a smaller UC base damage improvement, and gives your melee strikes\na chance of performing a mini-arcjolt (striking between 3-6 connected\ntargets at random). When brought to 50% of your max HP or below, they will\nunleash a full-size arcjolt instead (with double the base damage of their\nmelee strikes). This should hopefully be a bit more interesting than Just\nMore Damage and who *hasn't* wished they could replace their hands with\neels? Well, the future is here now.\n\n----------------------------\n\nEel hands form and talisman tiles, as well as adjustments to blade form\nand talisman tiles, were done by regret-index. The eel talisman uses\nDenzi's old Aizul tile and unused Trident of the Octopus King tile by\nroctavian, while the default form tiles use an unused Spellbinder player\ndoll tile. The felid form tile separately combines Sastreii's dragon felid\ntile with tentacles from a rejected tentacled monstrosity tile by\nroctavian.\n\nBlade form tiles were made using Denzi's original blade hands tile,\nontoclasm's felid and octopode blade tiles, and Sastreii's current blade\ntalisman. The felid form tile also combines these with roctavian's old\nblack bear tile.",

      "message": "Rework Maw form\n\nMaw form provided a very strong boost to the direct damage of fast attacks\n(short blades in particular) for relatively little investment or downside.\nThere were arguments that it flattened short blade gameplay by making it\ntoo easy to increase one's direct damage to the point where one could\nignore some of the more unique ways that short blade gameplay theoretically\ndiffers from other weapons (ie: stealth/stabbing).\n\nOn top of that, it was also not particularly good as a roll from protean\ntalisman in the earlygame, providing less upfront power compared to other\noptions.\n\nAs part of a group of changes, this moves maw back to 12 skill, gives it a\nmore impactful (and hopefully interesting) downside, makes its power a bit\nmore equitable between weapon types, and alters its healing mechanics.\n\n-Maw's bite is now aut-normalized, attacking once per 15 aut on average.\n-Maw's base damage is lower, but also directly increased by 3/4th of the\n player's strength.\n-Instead of a direct healing effect (with some... rather unusual math\n involved...), all eligible melee kills in Maw form now provide a short\n duration of greatly accellerated regeneration. This works out to a fair\n bit more healing on average than before (but less rapidly, especially if\n killing multiple enemies quickly.) and with a more intuitive scaling from\n shapeshifting skill.\n-The 'chance of growl on spotting an edible monster' now also mesmerises\n the player briefly. Unlike the Obsidian Axe, this is not a permanent\n effect, and won't immediately snap to another monster when that one is\n killed, so it shouldn't be too awful, but should provide a relevant and\n distinct downside that doesn't rely on melding gear.\n\nOverall, this talisman should still fit the role of 'give more melee damage\nto any weapon and provide healing on kills' while having a somewhat wider\nrange of characters interested in using it and more equitable up/downsides.\n(I realize that 'wants high strength, yet penalizes heavy armour the most'\nmay sound contradictory, but my hope is that this provides a natural\ncounterbalance to maximizing value from this form, and opens up the door\nfor some less conventional combinations.)",

      "message": "Handle player regen before durations are decremented for the turn\n\nThis meant that statuses which increase the player's regeneration (like\nTrog's Hand or rollpage) could expire without doing anything at all that\nturn - especially if the player was taking slow actions.\n\nThis is a pretty small deal most of the time, but a subsequent commit will\nadd a very short-duration regen effect where this could often eat up the\nmajority of it.\n\nI cannot see any clear reason why things were handled in this order, or any\nother negative consequence that might happen by reordering them, but I may\nbe wrong.\n\n(I also took the time to tidy some code into _decrement_durations() which\nspecifically had been left out since they *had* to happen after regen.)",
