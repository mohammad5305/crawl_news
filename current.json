And it's fine for it to be popular and strong\n(it should be strong, given the investment involved and its other\ndownsides!), but the sheer degree of difference in power some species, like\nfelids or octopodes, gain from reaching this this form is potentially\ntroublesome and risks still being the central focus even with more diverse\noptions available.\n\nSo now statue form also gives -20% EV while in it. This will affect felids\nthe most, and trolls the least, among those who regularly use it (and that\nis fine, since trolls had a real decision between armour and statue form,\nwhile felids could often feel like there was no equivalently viable\noption at all.) And, thematically, it's always felt a little weird that one\nis just as dodgy as a solid stone statue.\n\n(I realize that statue used to penalize EV in past and that was removed,\nbut context has changed enough that I think it's worth trying again.)\n\nIn addition, statue exchanges some of its base UC bonus for flat strength.\nThe aim is that this is 'about the same' for unarmed characters, while\nbeing a buff to strength users of the form, to slightly diversify its\nbenefits.",

      "message": "Significantly adjust talisman drop rates\n\nTalisman chance for floor items is now by tier instead of by individual\ntalisman (reducing boilerplate and making more future-proof). Curve of\ntier versus item level is changed.\n\nTalismans that are a 'low' tier compared to current item level have a\nsignificantly elevated chance to be a randart (which, in theory, might\nsometimes encourage someone to use a less conventional form, while the\nmundane version of the talisman would never be considered by that point.)\n\nTalismans obtained by acquirement have an additional 25% chance to be a\nrandarts (many items have a *significantly* higher chance to be randarts\nwhen made this way, but previously talismans did not).\n\nMany more talismans drop in the game in total (now that there is a lot more\ndiversity of options) and their drop chance no longer decreases so\ndramatically with depth. I've taken a bunch of the weight for this out of\nstones, though the previous non-linear curve of talisman chance versus\nother item chance means that it's impossible to keep exactly the same ratio\nof other stuff, game-long. The effect should be small, however.\n\nCurrently, due to several existing talismans being regularly used in\nvaults, while almost none of the new ones are, the drop chance for many\nold talismans is still markedly higher than new ones of equivalent tier.\nBut this should be nudged in a future commit that distributes new ones\nbetter.",

      "message": "Add Protean talismans (for Shapeshifter start)\n\nHaving a diversity of early/midgame forms is good for the variety of anyone\nwho might pivot into shapeshifting by finding these talismans during the\ngame, and it feels sad to canonize just one of them by putting it into the\nshapeshifter start (and thus heavily limiting who is likely to actually use\nit), but we'd hardy want to make shapeshifter start with 4 different\ntalismans of the same tier, either.\n\nThis is an attempt to randomize what capstone form shapeshifter will end up\nwith, while limiting the startscumming incentives that would come with just\ngiving the player a random talisman at the start. Instead, they are given a\nprotean talisman that *turns into* a random tier 2 talisman when evoked\nwith at least 6 shapeshifting skill (ie: slightly below the min skill to\nuse whatever it turns into).\n\n(I have picked a mix of full-body and partial-meld forms for this tier,\nsince I've seen it reasonably argued that full-body forms make species much\nless important to the background than it would otherwise be, but at the\nsame time, I feel like they're an important part of the shapeshifting\nfantasy - to become something monstrous and very unlike one's normal form.\nSo this allows us to split the difference.)\n\nProtean talismans are not intended to generate as floor items (though some\nvaults could still be allowed to place them.)\n\n----------------------\n\nThe protean talisman tile was made by regret-index, and combines\nSastreii's protean progenitor tile with ontoclasm's elemental wellspring\ntile.",

      "message": "Move Maw form down a tier, adjust properties somewhat\n\nMaw form has been fairly popular, but in a way that is extremely lopsided.\nFully 68% of maw form wins are with draconians (which notably get the form\nwith 0 downsides while *also* being a terrible fit for statue form), while\nfelids and octopodes account for 21%, and all other species *combined* only\nreach 11%.\n\nIt turns out, losing body armour is a really big ask and even a very good\naux attack is usually hard to justify for it - the attack/defense tradeoff\njust isn't comfortable for something that *also* takes training. And while\nthe heal-on-kills can be strong, it isn't enough to rely on when you're\ntrying to get the ball rolling.\n\nSo this commit targets it a bit earlier, while also attempting to make it\na bit less biased by species. Instead of melding your body armour\ncompletely, Maw form now reduces its base AC by 80%. This is *close* to\nmelding it for vanilla armour, but significantly less penalizing with\nenchanted/randart armour and skill. At the same time, its damage has been\nreduced slightly and it now also gives reflavored shoutitis as your maw\ngrowls hungrily at anything it might eat (such that it's not *completely*\nfree for draconians). It will still be *better* for draconians than anyone\nelse, which is fine, but hopefully not to such a polarising degree.",

      "message": "Turn Flux Form into a new type of consumable\n\nShapeshifters, as a background, change their form surprisingly few times\nover the course of the earlygame. They start already transformed, and\npossibly change form just once in the first 10 levels, to use their flux\ntalisman (though some players opt not to do even that). It feels to me that\na little something about 'having a mutable form' was lost with the advent\nof talismans over old form spells, and this is an attempt to recapture some\nof that without (hopefully) the problems the old system had.\n\nFlux Baubles are a new type of consumable that can be used to temporarily\nenter Flux Form (which, conveniently, was already thematically defined by\nbeing unstable!). The form lasts for a certain number of contam attacks\n(rather than time), after which the player reverts to their previous form.\nUsing a bauble takes only a single turn (rather than the slow change of a\ntalisman). It still scales with shapeshifting skill in the exact same\nmanner that talisman forms do.\n\nThe idea is that flux form can still come online before the shapeshifter's\nnew capstone talisman will, but will be a transient power surge. The player\ncan use it for scarier situations (and a few battles afterward), and it can\neven retain some use after their capstone talisman is useable (both by\nbeing *transiently* more powerful than low-skill capstone forms, and also\nsometimes allowing you to quickly escape certain form downsides at the cost\nof a consumable).\n\nFlux form is generally more powerful than it used to be (its EV boost now\nscales with skill, for instance) since it is a short-lived thing. (It also\nnow melds gloves mostly as a thematic thing, since it was unclear how your\ntouch could be so mutagenically unstable that it melded weapons but *not*\nyour gloves.)\n\nInternally, baubles are implemented as a new item base type, largely for\nease of generating them randomly in levels, but I think there is future\npotential for more types of baubles - either high-level temporary forms, or\nmaybe even 'early' but transient access to some normal forms, eg: Storm\nBauble?\n\nA handful of flux baubles replace Shapeshifter's potion of lignification.\n\n------------------\n\nThe flux bauble and new flux form tiles were made by regret-index.\n * The baubles combine Sastreii's previous flux talisman with CC0 bombs\n   by chrisblue.\n * The humanoid flux overlay heavily modifies CanOfWorm's Irradiate vfx.\n * The felid flux form tile combines Denzi's various felid bases with a\n   heavily modified explosion from the CC0 release of DUELYST 1.\n * The octopode flux form uses the same explosion with an edit by Darby of\n   Bloax's base octopode tile.",

      "message": "New form: Medusa\n\nThe 3rd new form aimed at being a Shapeshifter capstone, Medusa form melds\nthe player's helmet and cloak and replaces their hair/head with a long mane\nof jellyfish-like tendrils. Yes, *that* kind of medusa.\n\nWhenever the player attacks in melee, their tendrils lash out\nautomatically, inflicting poison on several random nearby enemies (with\nshapeshifting skill increasing the number affected at once).\n\nBut it's also the *other* type of medusa: when the player is reduced to\n60% HP, they automatically empower all poison near them, giving a\nskill-based chance to petrify any nearby poisoned enemies. (As is becoming\na wider trend, this cooldown is restored only when you fully heal again.)\n\nWhile automatic AoE petrify is a strong effect, it taking multiple turns\nand only *starting* once the player is already injured (on a form that\ndoesn't otherwise have defensive benefits) will hopefully keep it from\nbeing excessive, while still being distinctive and fun. (And it can even\ncombo a little with other sources of AoE poison, like OTR!). And if maybe\nit encourages a shapeshifter to pick up a shortblade and train some\nstabbing skill, I think that could be good, too.\n\n(The form also comes with rPois.)\n\n-------------------\n\nThe medusa form and polyp talisman tiles were made by regret-index.\n * Polyp talisman: Free use seaweed by finalbossblues, a CC0 stone by\n   idylwilds, and ontoclasm's original runed door tiles.\n * Medusa humanoids: A CC0 jar by Jetrel, Denzi's old jellyfish, and\n   a CC0 alien robot by Emcee Flesher.\n * Medusa octopode: The above medusa form components mixed with Bloax's\n   default octopode tile.\n * Medusa felid: The above medusa form components mixed with Sastreii's\n   statue felid tile and LemurRobot + CanofWorms's vampire felid tile.",

      "message": "New form: Sun Scarab\n\nAnother full-body form targeted as a Shapeshifter starter capstone (fire\nto contrast with rime yak's ice!), sun scarab draws from the Egyptian\nmythological associations of a scarab beetle pushing the sun around by\ncoming with its own pseudo-battlesphere that provides the bulk of its\npower.\n\nWhile in this form, the player will have a 'solar ember' that follows\nalongside them. It uses similar leashing behavior to phalanx beetles, but\nadditionally will not move while already adjacent to the player (so that\nits positioning remains predictable while the player fights.)\n\nEvery second time the player attacks in melee, their solar ember will\nunleash a blast of fire against all enemies adjacent to it (and damage\nitself somewhat). This is the major source of scarab form's bonus damage,\nand requires positioning in ways that allow the orb to damage things\nwithout itself being destroyed (for example, corridors don't work at all!).\nSwapping places with the ember heals it substantially, however, allowing\nthe player to keep their damage source alive in exchange for sometimes\nexposing themselves to more danger.\n\nIf the ember is destroyed, it will automatically respawn a number of turns\nlater (ancestor-style), but this is still a big problem for the form, which\nderives most of its power from it being alive.\n\nOn its own, scarab's melee attacks have a 50% chance of applying rF- to\ntheir target if they pass AC (which allows you to 'focus' a target for\nthe ember's damage, as well as synergize with other fire spells the player\nmay have) and you gain wizardry for fire spells (much like rime yak does\nfor ice). You also have rF++ and rPois-.\n\nThe hope is that this is a cute change of positional play for melee, that\nmakes you really feel like you're in a different form, while also being\nas distinct from rime yak is possible (ie: rime yak wants nearby walls and\nsun scarab wants open space!)\n\n--------------------\n\nThe sun scarab form and solar ember tiles were made by regret-index. The\ntalisman was made by LemurRobot.\n * The sun scarab form mixes one of Denzi's old helmets with both his old\n   boring beetle and boulder beetle tiles.\n * The solar ember combines Denzi's old sun demon tile with a CC0 block by\n   Emcee Flesher.",

      "message": "Revamp dragon talisman somewhat\n\nDragon form was always relatively unpopular due to its (somewhat\nunintuitive) melee glass cannon nature. But beyond that, \"You do a ton of\nmelee damage, but your breath weapon is barely even worth using.\" is a\nterrible flavor fit for monsters who are most iconically defined *by* their\nbreath, in my opinion.\n\nThe breath weapon (as a remnant of being so ancient that it once was a\ngeneral mutation) also scaled with player XL and not shapeshifting skill in\nany fashion, contrary to... basically every scaling form property these\ndays.\n\nThis commit aims to improve the situation in the following ways:\n -The default dragon type is now a golden dragon, rather than a fire\n  dragon (per regret-index's suggestion). This arguably gives it a bit of\n  a niche as a 'resistances' form to contrast with its overall mediocre raw\n  defenses (due to its size).\n -The breath weapon is now *substantially* more powerful, but shares the\n  same XP recharge system that draconian breath does (which seems to have\n  been pretty successful.) It effectively fires all 3 golden dragon breath\n  types at once, doing a piercing line of fire and cold damage, and leaving\n  poisonous clouds behind. It scales with shapeshifting skill, not XL.\n -The UC boost has been meaningfully reduced (and default tail slap aux\n  removed - though draconians retain theirs), with the idea that the\n  breath should account for a meaningful chunk of its overall power.\n -Draconians get a substantial shapeshifting skill-based boost to their own\n  breath power (instead of the form flatly doubling it), but it also\n  recharges twice as quickly (to match the recharge rate of non-draconians\n  using this talisman).\n\nNumbers are a bit provisional on some of this, but the hope is that it\nfeels appealing to more people, and also more 'like a dragon' to play as.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe golden dragon talisman, form, ability icon, and vfx were edited and\nmade by regret-index.\n * The talisman recolours the previous dragon-coil talisman using the\n   older fire dragon design made by Denzi and edited by roctavian, Marbit,\n   and Bloax.\n * The form tiles all recolour Sastreii's regular, felid, and octopode\n   dragon form tiles.\n * The golden breath icon combines ontoclasm's Spit Poison, Breathe Fire,\n   and Breathe Frost tiles.\n * The golden breath vfx combines Sastreii's light bolt with roctavian's\n   Throw Fire and Throw Frost effects.",

So it's a full-body from that wants to be\nused by character who *can* use heavy body armour.\n\nOutside of this, the form has slow movement (in-between naga and barachi),\nrPois- and rCorr, a modest UC bonus, and can breathe clouds of rust at the\ncost of its own HP - a new cloud type that inflicts corrode and weak (but\nonly a small bit of direct damage, unlike acid clouds). What sort of crab\nwould it be if it *couldn't* spew clouds, I ask?\n\nNote: fortress crab is also capable of wielding a weapon in its main hand!\nI envisoned something a little like a fiddler crab, capable of gripping\nsomething at least well enough to bonk another person with it.\n\n-----------------\n\nThe fortress talisman, fortress crab form, and rust cloud / ability tiles\nwere made by regret-index.\n * The fortress talisman mixes Coolio's fire crab tile with free use world\n   map fortress tiles and armour tiles by Idylwilds.\n * The fortress crab form mixes those current crab and fortress tiles with\n   Malwyn's original fire crab tile.\n * The Breath Rust icon uses NormalPerson7's ink cloud tile.\n * The rust clouds remix ontoclasm's seething chaos clouds tiles.",

      "message": "New form: Walking Scroll\n\nThis is a tier 1 form (ie: the same tier as Quill form, but *not* in any\nstarter package) intended to provide unique appeal as an early caster form\n(and possibly tempt some characters to unconventionally train shapeshifting\nearly and then maybe transition into later forms afterward).\n\nThis is a full-body form that increases your skill with *all magic schools*\nby half of your shapeshifting skill, but prevents you from casting spells\nabove level 4. Your attacks also inflict 50% less damage, but have a 50%\nchance of restoring 1 MP when you hit, and you gain a small bonus to your\nmax MP (4-9, based on skill).\n\nThe idea here is that it can be a powerful boon to an early caster who\ntrains a little shapeshifting, but automatically falls off hard after a\nlittle while (while possibly prompting the player to try out other forms\nwith the skill they've already learned.)\n\n(In future, I hope to implement a few randart variants that even allow you\nto 'read' yourself for a scroll effect.)\n\n-------------------\n\nInkwell talisman and living scroll form tiles made by regret-index.\nThe former edits a CC0 inkwell by idylwilds, while the latter combines CC0\nscrolls by idylwilds and deep dwarf berserkers by coolio.",

When this\nbonus reaches +5 (and with a chance on each kill afterward), the player can\nlet out a vicious howl that attempts to freeze all visible enemies in fear\n(ie: *both* fear and -move) on a will check (power scaling with\nshapeshifting.)\n\nThey also come with the Bestial Takedown ability, which performs a jumping\nattack at +(75-125)% damage against any enemy who is currently afraid\n(whether from you howling at them, or any other source, like ?fear). Kills\nmade by Bestial Takedown will always cause you to perform a howl afterward.\n\nPlay pattern-wise, this lends itself to building up over an extended fight\nand then leaping around like a slavering beast as you pounce and kill\nenemy after enemy (or sometimes reading ?fear immediately to enable your\nwild assault!).\n\nAs baseline benefits, werewolves also get Regen+ and the equivalent of\nclaws 3, along with rC+ (fur!) and str/dex +3, but meld all aux slots\n(like beast form once did) and have Will-.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe lupine talisman, werewolf form tiles, and new ability icons were made\nby regret-index.\n * The lupin talisman mixes Sastreii's previous beast talisman with the\n   Claws mutation icon by LemurRobot.\n * The humanoid form tiles combine Denzi's old hell beasts with Sastreii's\n   beast form tile and CanofWorms's edit of Sastreii's wolf tile. The\n   naga one mixes this with Sastreii's base naga player doll tile, the\n   djinn one with Team Impy's djinn player doll tile, and the armataur one\n   with Sastreii's armataur player doll tile.\n * The felid werewolf form combines Denzi's current felid tiles with\n   CanofWorms's edit of Sastreii's wolf tile. The octopode werewolf form\n   combines Bloax's base octopode player doll with the same wolf tile.\n * The Bestial Takedown icon uses ontoclasm's Power Leap icon mixed with\n   some of Bloax's Corona icon sparkles.",

      "message": "New form: Sphinx\n\nAnother granite-tier form, sphinx comes with AF_AIRSTRIKE flavored melee\n(like sphinx mauraders) that does increased damage based on the number of\nopen spaces around a monster (scaling with shapeshifting skill), as well as\nplaying around with slot mechanics introduced this version. While in sphinx\nform, a player can wear a cloak and barding (even if they ordinarily could\nnot!).\n\nSphinx form also grants major wizardry for hexes spells and reduces the\nWill of enemies to resists player effects by 40 (like half an orb of guile,\nbut without the downside).\n\nAs a minor (and mostly flavorful) downside, while in sphinx form the player\nwill compulsively pose riddles to enemies they run into. This is mostly a\nreflavored shoutitis, though it has a very small chance to confuse/vex an\nenemy instead of just alerting them. A bunch of uniques also have specific\nresponses to being annoyed by a riddle!\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe sphinx form tiles and prelminary riddle talisman tiles were made by\nregret-index.\n * The initial talisman combines CC0 wall tiles by Emcee Flesher with\n   amulet tiles by Denzi.\n * The sphinx form tiles mix Bloax's old Frances tile, Denzi's sphinx\n   tile, and a CC0 wing icon by frosty_rabbid. The felid sphinx tile\n   uses Denzi's old Jessica tile and current felid tiles with the same\n   wing.",

      "message": "New Form: Aqua\n\nThis is a blade-tier form which turns the user's body into a wellspring of\nelemental water which can change its shape fluidly. It is intended to offer\nanother 'substance-changing' form besides statue form (so that its\ninteraction with mutations are not a one-off) and allow the player to pull\noff some unique things.\n\nWhile in this form, the player's melee range is increased by two. And,\nunlike normal reaching, you are still able to perform aux attacks at this\ndistance since your *entire* body is stretching outward. (Yes, even if\nyou're made of water, you can still have functional horns - let's assume\nthat you're able to control the density of your water just as well.)\n\nThis additional range stacks with the reach of polearms (though you can't\nperform aux attacks at full polearm range). Axes *don't* cleave everything\nin range 3 (which would be absurd), but rather will just hit your main\ntarget and everything else adjacent to you. You also cannot stab things\nfrom a distance (which I think would be simply too powerful, especially on\ncharacters with reduced LoS range).\n\nTo sell the idea that you're really *made* of water, there are a few other\nupsides/downsides:\n -When damaged, you sometimes splatter temporary pools of water nearby\n  depending on how much damage was taken.\n -When damaged by fire beams, you sometimes explode in a cloud of steam.\n -When damaged by cold, you have a 50% chance of getting the Frozen status,\n  slowing your movement for a while.\n\nFinally, you have an active ability on an XP cooldown - Watery Grave. This\nturns all water within 4 tiles of the player against any enemy standing\natop it, doing water damage and also waterlogging these enemies for a short\nwhile (and removing all the shallow water). While the player may sometimes\nwant to use local water to activate this, it's important to note that in\nmost cases, you will be able to use this by maneuvering enemies over the\nwater that the player themselves has 'bled'!\n\n------------------------------\n\nAll aqua form tiles and ability icons were made by regret-index.\nThe wellspring talisman tile was made by LemurRobot.\n * The standard humanoid tiles combinine ontoclasm's water nymph with the\n   player doll defaults for humans (Denzi), armataurs (Sastreii), djinn\n   (Team Impy), and naga (Sastreii editing Denzi's).\n * Aqua form octopodes combines Sastreii's dragon octopode and death\n   form octopode tiles with Bloax's base octopode tile and ontoclasm's\n   water elemental tile.\n * Aqua form felids combine a CC0 water elemental by Clint Bellanger,\n   ontoclasm's elemental wellspring tile, and Sastreii's storm felid +\n   statue felid tiles.\n * The Watery Grave ability icon combines CC0 water textures by\n   finalbossblues with Purge's gravestone tiles.",

      "message": "New form: Living Hive\n\nThis is a statue-tier form, intended to diversify appealing options at that\ntier. It also melds body armour (and helm), providing a much smaller amount\nof AC, but also a significant amount of both HP and MP regeneration (which\nare improved by shapeshifting skill). In addition, whenever the player's HP\nfalls below 50%, multiple angry bees will swarm out from your body to\ndefend you. These come naturally berserk (and with the Concentrate Venom\nstatus!) to make something like a killer bee still relevant into lategame.\nLike Mark of the Celebrant, this status recharges only once the player\nreaches full HP again.\n\nThe hope was to provide something with enough defensive utility to be\nattractive to some of the characters who would otherwise consider statue\nform their main viable option, while being as different as possible. The\nMP regeneration it provides (and not slowing the player!) also makes it\nmarkedly stronger as a caster form than statue is (and potentially of\ninterest to characters who'd not otherwise consider training shapeshifting\nat all!)\n\nAnd who doesn't want to unleash swarms of bees upon their enemies?\n\n(Okawaru disapproves of this form - not only because the swarm of allies is\na core part of it, but the regeneration is even thematically coming from\nthe labor of your little friends and we all know that Oka hates friends.)\n\n-------------------\n\nThe hive form tiles and preliminary honeycomb talisman tiles were made by\nregret-index.\n * The initial talisman combines Denzi's old honeycomb and amulet tiles.\n * The hive form tiles use CC0 honeycomb tiles by delta12 studio. The\n   felid tile mixes it with Denzi's felid tiles and the octopode tile\n   mixes it with Bloax's base octopode player doll tile.",

      "message": "Replace Beast form with Quill form\n\nBeast form was, more or less, a glorified ring of slaying in exchange for\nyour aux armour. And while this could be a useful (if bland) trade in the\nearlygame, it felt to me like a bit of a waste of the traditionally very\npopular 'werewolf' fantasy. So I am planning to promote werewolf into a\nhigher-tier form where it can be a bit more exciting, and replace beast\nwith something else of suitable power level for shapeshifters to start in.\n\nQuill form also trades all of your aux armour away, but in return it makes\nyou spiny (with damage that scales with shapeshifting). 40% of melee\nattacks made against the player will trigger an automatic retaliation for\n1d2 - 1d8 damage (depending on shapeshifting skill). This is sometimes\nstronger than beast form's slaying and sometimes weaker, but also more\ndistinctive (and it makes the shapeshifter start more distinct *visually*\ntoo, in my opinion - selling the idea that you're a weird metamorph instead\nof just 'a slightly different colour adventurer').\n\n-----------------------\n\nThe quill talisman and form tiles are by regret-index.\n * The quill talisman combines a CC0 morningstar by idylwilds with an\n   unused tile for the Sceptre of Asmodeus by Denzi.\n * The humanoid form combines Sastreii's beast form tiles with roctavian's\n   old porcupine tile. Djinn combine this with Team Impy's djinn player\n   doll tile, Armataurs combine this with Sastreii's armataur player doll\n   tile, and Naga combine this with Sastreii's naga player doll tile.\n * Quill form felids use Denzi's old cat tiles with roctavian's porcupine.\n * Quill form octopodes combine roctavian's porcupine tile with Porkshop's\n   edit of dolphin's old octopode tile.",

      "message": "New form: Jumping Spider\n\nAnother thematic nod to an old form, but with major functional changes.\nThis is a blade-tier form with an emphasis on speed, evasion, and being a\nsneaky jerk.\n\nThe form provides an EV bonus (on top of being tiny), rampaging, a stealth\nbonus, a small chance to web enemies on melee hit, and short-blade quality\nstabs while unarmed. (And is rPois- minus, as is the spider tradition.)\n\nIn addition, you have an evasive jump ability, which is functionally like\na random blink (that isn't affected by silence or antimagic), but with\ntwo additional benefits:\n -The player is guaranteed to successfully dodge any dodgeable attack until\n  their next turn. (ie: nothing can hit you on the turn you jump)\n -Enemies have a chance to immediately lose track of you (ie: as if they\n  were wandering and hadn't spotted you yet.)\n\nRandom blink is often fairly unexciting past earlygame (and more controlled\nblinking is incredibly strong in obvious ways), but the hope is that these\nextra factors combine to make Jump a uniquely useful way to try and slip\naway from enemies (despite the risks of not knowing where you will land) -\nor even launch a rampage stab into their blind spots while they fumble\naround trying to see where you landed!\n\nLow AC full-body forms can be a tough sell past earlygame, but the hope is\nthat this provides enough benefits to be appealing to some characters\nnonetheless, and capture some of the feel of being a tiny sneaky menance.\n\n-------------\n\nThe jumping spider form, talisman, and ability icons were handled by\nregret-index.\n * The tile mixes roctavian's old spider genus monster tile with\n   LemurRobot's old culicivora tile and Denzi's old boring beetles.\n * The form tile mildly edits Bloax's old spider form tile.\n * The jump icon recolours ontoclasm's Blink icon.",

      "message": "New form: Rime Yak\n\nThis is the first of several forms aimed at being possible capstone forms\nfor the Shapeshifter background. As a bit of a nod to the old Ice Form,\nwhile blending in one of Crawl's most iconic animals, this is a full-body\nform that offers +15% HP, rC++, rF-, some scaling AC, and the ability to\nswim.\n\nInstead of doing cold damage in melee directly, whenever you perform a\nmelee attack, you chill a random wall adjacent to your target (and then\nadjacent to yourself, when those run out). Enemies adjacent to these frigid\nwalls take cold damage each turn (similar to frozen ramparts, though the\ndamage scales mildly with each additional frozen wall). These walls do not\ndisappear when the player moves, though the expire rapidly if you stop\nattacking. Like ramparts, they can chill cold-blooded enemies - one of the\nmore notable upsides ice form used to have.\n\nHopefully this melee behavior makes them feel a little different to play\nthan just 'branded melee' while also promoting the different positional\nconsiderations.\n\nIn addition, the player has wizardry with all Ice spells while in this\nform (equivalent to two rings). I think it may be interesting for forms\nto offer some 'side' bonuses outside of their core niche, to potentially\npromote different skilling decisions or appeal to characters that might\notherwise pass on them. And ideally this encourages some shapeshifters\nto learn magic when they otherwise wouldn't, and some mages to use\ntalismans when they otherwise wouldn't.\n\n----------------------\n\nThe rime yak form and talisman tiles were made by regret-index.\n * The talisman combines Sastreii's eye simulacrum with a horned beast\n   from the CC0 release of Duelyst 1.\n * The rime yak form tile combines ontoclasm's fish simulacrum with\n   CanofWorms's edits of Sastreii's yak, death yak, and catoblepas tiles.\n * The rime wall tiles combine Denzi's old Freeze Ammunition tiles with\n   CC0 wall tiles by cynicmusic.",

(Along with a handful of form-specific things\nlike blinkbolt damage and vampire healing chance.)\n\nAnd, in general, the information is presented in a more compressed format\nthat is easier to read at a glance.\n\nTalisman database entries have most lines about their slot-melding removed,\nsince they are now redundant with the more explicit listing right below\nthat.\n\nMany Form methods are refactored to accept a specific skill value (with -1\ndefaulting to 'the player's current skill')",

      "message": "Change a number of things about how forms and mutations interact\n\nThere were a number of poorly-known or understood quirks about which\nmutations were suppressed by which forms. While the system was *mostly*\nsimple in theory, it resulted in numerous oddities. For instance, gargoyles\nlost their rElec in many forms (but kept their rN), thin skeletal structure\nwas kept in explicitly boneless forms (even though it is not possible to\nmutate it on a boneless species), time-warped blood was possible to mutate\non bloodless species (though it would always be inactive), naga poison spit\nwas usable in most forms that draconian breath weapons were not, and\nperhaps most jarring of all: gargoyles were vulnerable to LRD in all forms\n- even as a wisp!\n\nThis commit makes a number of changes aimed at fixing some of the more\nillogical interactions, making behavior more clearly explicated in-game,\nunifying and simplifying some code, and (hopefully) improving gameplay in a\nfew specific cases.\n\nFollowing some dev discussion, forms can now be considered to modify only\nthe player's anatomy while leaving their substance alone (ie: most\nfully-body animal forms), only their substance while leaving their anatomy\nalone (ie: statue form), or modifying both (ie: tree form). Suppressable\nmutations are tagged as belonging to either of these categories (along with\na couple smaller categories used to unify some existing mutation behavior,\nlike 'needs blood')\n\nGargoyle's AC, petrification resistance, and such are now considered\nexplicitly a property of their body being stone, and are 'substance'\nmutations. They now retain all of these in anatomy-changing forms (meaning\nthat serpent form turns you into a *stone* serpent, instead of a fleshy\none), but lose them in substance-changing forms (no more being deconstructed\nas a wisp!)\n -This is a clear buff to gargoyle shapeshifting, but they still have -3\n  apt and I'd argue it's more interesting to keep their core racial perks\n  in more forms instead of those not even being a consideration.\n\nNaga and barachi slow movement are now explicitly tied to their naga tail\nand hop mutations (as 'anatomy'), and they will either retain both or lose\nboth in any form.\n -This does mean that statue naga are much slower than they used to be,\n  though it was unclear why statue was a 'standard' speed for everyone\n  anyway.\n\nSpriggan fast movement is now explicitly magical and no longer suppressed\nin any form.\n -Spriggans had the best shapeshifting apt in the game (and are\n  mythologically famous for changing forms), but the combination of their\n  abyssmal unarmed combat *and* losing the core gimmick that makes\n  spriggans any good at all meant that a majority of forms were a complete\n  non-option for them. I think it's more interesting if they get to keep\n  their core identity while transforming, and hope this opens up a little\n  more variety for them.\n\nGnoll item detection is reworded to no longer be a property of their noses\n(how did that work, anyway?) to put aside questions about suppressing it.\n\nMost general resistance mutations are considered now considered\n'substance' mutations, meaning they will be retained in many full-body\nforms that used to suppress them, but lost in statue form. The latter is\nnot a deliberate balance change, but a consequence of trying to apply\nmostly-predictable rules to this system. Statue form can be individually\nadjusted later, if needbe.\n\nMutations can no longer be 'partially suppressed' (which was a fair bit of\ncode complexity that was currently used almost entirely to remove AC\nbonuses from demonspawn scale mutations while retaining their other\nbonuses - not that it even said what 'partially suppressed' meant in-game!)\nSince statue form already suppresses most resistances now, this is double\nneedless, in my opinion.\n\nIn-game mutation descriptions now show what category a mutation belongs to,\nand forms explicate which of these categories they suppress (though I hope\nthat the relationship will be largely intuitive to players, once they get\nused to it).\n\nCode that controls what mutations the player is eligable to mutate is now\nalso unified with code that controls what mutations are suppressed in forms\n(rather than being incompletely duplicated).\n\nFinally, silver has a more predictable interaction with player forms: the\nplayer now takes full damage from it when in any form at all (instead of it\nbeing an ad hoc list that somehow considered being a snake more chaotic\nthan flux form!)",

      "message": "Change a number of things about tail-slaps and stinger mutation\n\nHandling of the tail slap aux attack and stinger mutation were a little\ntangled. Determining whether the player could perform this aux was done\nvia exclusion (ie: 'if you have a tail, but not any of these other tails')\nwhich was more opaque than necessary. Also, it led to several odd\nsituations, like:\n -Draconians tail-slap aux wasn't displayed anywhere in-game\n -Naga could mutate a venomous stinger, but never actually attack with it\n\nThis commit rearranges some logic and makes the following functional\nchanges:\n -Any species with a tail (except merfolk) can mutate a stinger and\n  actually attack with it if they do so. Yes, this includes felids.\n  (The fact that a regular cat tail isn't a useful weapon seems moot when\n  you've explictly mutated a scorpion stinger, imo.)\n -The 'tail-slap' attack is actually called 'sting' if you have a stinger.\n  Scorpions don't go around slapping people with their tails!\n -Draconians of all sorts now share MUT_ARMOURED_TAIL with armataurs. This\n  mutation is now 2 levels, so that armataurs can retain their higher\n  damage. (Both species aux damage is unchanged.)\n -MUT_STINGER is generally buffed. While other species could ocassionally\n  get it, it was primarily a green draconian species mutation, and they\n  were a bit on the weaker side (and the mutation was *quite* weak, giving\n  only +1 damage on their aux and a 50% chance to apply one level of poison\n  when it passed AC - not very exciting at XL 14!).\n  -MUT_STINGER now gives +3 damage per level (and green dracs get 2). The\n   poison can now apply even if the main hit doesn't do damage (ie: the\n   same as venom weapons - and a large part of why those are even good),\n   which also helps naga/felids who mutate this aux without the base damage\n   of a tail slap behind it.\n\nMost mutations should properly update on upgraded saves, though green dracs\nwon't recieve their second level of stinger. (This would require more\ninvolved save compat code, given that it's in the general mutation pool,\nand doesn't seem important enough to bother.)",

      "message": "Simplify duration handling for forms\n\nThe FormDuration class (and its various ways to convert transformation\npower into randomized duration) was clearly a holdover from temporary form\nspells, and mostly made it slightly more opaque to calculate the duration\nof what temporary transformations still remain.\n\nThis class (and associated code/member of form_entry) is removed, and any\ntemporary transformation effects specify their durations directly (instead\nof specifying power which was run through FormDuration). All bad forms in\nthe game used the exact same numbers anyway, and the only temporary\npositive effects are Bat Swarm and Vessel of Slaughter.\n\nPolymorph/Porkalator have their formula simplified; duration no longer\nscales with power (power already affects success chance, after all) and\nthe average is a fair bit shorter (and the maximum significantly shorter).\nThe high roll durations on hostile polymorph were generally excessive;\nthe player was likely to either be dead or completely out of the battle\nbefore then (at which point, more turns doesn't mean much).\n\nI have preserved the existing duration formula for !lignification exactly\n(as this is the most important player-facing one). The few other sources,\nlike Nemelex or Jiyva wrath, have also been simplified, but are rare and\nunimportant enough that numbers are fairly arbitrary and unlikely to matter\nmuch.\n\n(Finally, I also removed some code for handling extending durations of\nexisting duration-based transformations, which as far as I can tell is no\nlonger possible.)",

There's some worrying issues with objstat's feature\ncount reflecting very different odds from mapstat on whether or not adding\nthe tag does anything meaningful (possibly from not regenerating the .des\ncache properly?), and whether or not the `chance_foo` tag properly works\nto avoid rerolling into the same vault, but this does immediately help the\nproblem at hand by moving from 100% chance to place in D over 100\niterations to ~29% over 100 iterations.",

      "message": "Move gnolls from 'g' to 'j' glyphs\n\nThe 'g' glyph hosts a somewhat eclectic set of differing monsters:\nGoblins, gnolls, boggarts, and dwarves. (Some of this is inherited from\nwhen the Dwarven Halls wanted their own batch of dwarves and were moved\nfrom 'q' to 'g' to help distinguish classed draconians in Zot.) With three\nout of four of these having gained player representation back in 0.32 as\nquite popular species with straightforward flavour, there's a reasonable\nincentive to have some additional monsters for them in the future (such\nas a gnoll with an actual spread of different spells, coglin forgewrights,\nor goblins recklessly trying other means of gaining power). The glyph,\nhowever, contains 14 monsters already, leaving very little space in\nconsole to add any further without some change.\n\nTo facilitate this, I'm splitting these apart based on cliches of size.\nGnolls have no history nor media depicting them particularly as small\nspirits, which otherwise unites goblins, boggarts, and dwarves. (Crawl\ndwarves not being small is silly, but a long foregone matter.) They are\nthus being moved into their own seperate glyph using one of the few\nremaining current unused console glyphs, 'j': 'j'nolls shouldn't be much\nweirder than the decade or so of 'g'warves. All monsters involved are\notherwise preserving their colours, aside from dwarf dummy monsters being\nmoved from green to Wiglaf's lightgreen (since nearly all dummy monsters\nare locked behind glass anyway).\n\n(Honestly, it'd help with several other spaces if we could add more\nconsole glyphs outside of standard keyboards, as constructs are overloaded\non '9' and dogs / cats / bears / hogs are crammed full into 'h', but even\nif we committed to doing such they'd still need some deliberate division\nas been done here.)",

(It's\n   hard to tell how many people also died to not bothering to cancel the\n   teleport, though.) They've been pushed deeper into the Depths\n   depth-scaling and are somewhat less common (with alderking weight\n   pushed up slightly to compensate), as a consequence. They also have had\n   some of their numbers slashed slightly- less hp, lower cast rate for\n   their breath, and speed 12 over speed 13.

The webt iles sever responds\nwith a `rcfile_contents` message that has a `content s` property.\n\nBecause the response doesn't include `game_id`, the client has to treat\nthis as a stateful request. It has to remember what was recently\nrequested and can't pipeline multiple requests.\n\nThe current webtiles client stores this state in the\n UI and will ignore\nthe additional property. But its existence will simp lify design of\nfuture webtiles clients.",

The webt iles sever responds\nwith a `rcfile_contents` message that has a `content s` property.\n\nBecause the response doesn't include `game_id`, the client has to treat\nthis as a stateful request. It has to remember what was recently\nrequested and can't pipeline multiple requests.\n\nThe current webtiles client stores this state in the\n UI and will ignore\nthe additional property. But its existence will simp lify design of\nfuture webtiles clients.",

The cursor positioning is\nmade unnecessary by placing the message window at the top of the\nterminal, and by clearing old messages (see also \"Options for blind\nplayers\" from the options_guide).",

The cursor positioning is\nmade unnecessary by placing the message window at the top of the\nterminal, and by clearing old messages (see also \"Options for blind\nplayers\" from the options_guide).",

      "message": "Move ghost vaults into the Necropolis, a game-long repeating portal\n\nGhost vaults, while a reasonable approach to the former issues of\ndeliberately making spoilery griefing ghosts way back when, have a variety\nof implementation issues in the current day:\n\n * While newcomers may willingly walk into out-of-depths put on direct\n   display, many cautious experienced players will put off the vast bulk\n   of them until they're harmless (give or take zombies), which throws out\n   most of their interest and complexity. This capacity to backtrack also\n   make the majority of early vaults contain minimal rewards, which itself\n   further emphasizes them as mostly a trap early on.\n\n * Their need for sufficiently-varied themes somewhat distort the branches\n   they appear in, with undead in many branches that otherwise avoid being\n   unholy, Slime spawns in Elf, or Xom and Lugonu absolutely everywhere\n   with little restraint or care.\n\n * In Depths and Zot, three quarters of ghost vaults using \"ORIENT: float\"\n   ends up eating the regular vault slot those floors could have used for\n   distinct and flashy vaults that aren't particularly stuck as optional\n   challenges.\n\nTo address all of these concerns at once, especially the first of these,\nI am porting them all into a new portal: the Necropolis. Up to three of\nthese can spawn each game: One in D, Lair, or Orc; one in Snake, Swamp,\nSpider, Shoals, or Vaults; and one in Elf, Depths, or Crypt.\n\nEach Necropolis contains entry groves, wide-open empty halls, and three\nghost vaults, in an attempt to distinguish them compared to other confined\nportals. Ghost vaults themselves on average have been made larger to\naccommodate this, and are each still discrete optional chambers held\nbehind runed doors or transporters; as thus a free selection of given\nchallenges, it should also feel different enough from other portals to\nfunction fine in its own highlighted fashion. (Many vaults have been\ngiven some marginal additional rewards and weakened when appearing early,\nbut it is fine if players do not opt to take all or even some of the\nchallenges each Necropolis, since this is mostly focused on improving the\nstatus quo; in this same spirit, Necropolis portals take 50% longer to\ndisappear than other portals, so people won't feel as rushed.)\n\n(This portal also comes with a large amount of unique tiles to try and\nevoke a certain muted starry otherworld, as well as a variety of new\nentry vaults, some preliminary layouts, and my own hand at themed vaults\nscaled throughout the game. See prior commits for tile credits there.)\n\nAlongside those 10 more ghost vaults to join a total of about 42 other\nghost vaults, there are many specific implementation wrinkles involved:\n\n * The entry gardens use runed doors so instant autotravel defaults on\n   webtiles aren't going to completely miss the non-ghost-vault parts\n   of each level, which mildly slows down play but hardly by enough for\n   me to particularly worry much.\n\n * The outsider perimeters of ghost vaults are not no longer tagged as\n   no_tele_into, since there's so much more space around them now. To\n   reduce the overall effectiveness of teleporting right as one opens up\n   runed doors for this portal dependent on them, all vaults are tagged\n   as patrolling, so it's now much harder to split up the vault's contents\n   away from one another.\n\n * Ghost vaults that just contain one ghost and ghost vaults that focus\n   almost solely on undead monsters can only appear once a floor, to try\n   and reduce the portal feeling too much like Ossuary 2: Crypt 4.\n\n * No Necropolis entries appear in Zot despite ghost vaults existing there\n   previously, as that contains no portals. There have been additions to\n   Zot's stair vaults over the past few versions, so this shouldn't be too\n   much of a loss to that branch.\n\n * Lair branch appearances sans Slime (i.e. Snake, Swamp, Shoals, Spider)\n   regularly use subvault contents across branches, and the latest\n   appearances of Necropolis (Vaults and Elf, Depths and Crypt) always\n   share their contents entirely. Portal vaults at this depth already\n   pull from extended branches like the Hells and Pan, or outright\n   contain unique monsters entirely like Desolation, so there is a\n   pressing need to be able to vary up ghost vault contents with\n   sufficient difficulty to reasonable compare to the endpoints of those\n   portals. Additionally, Elf and Crypt both have very limited monster\n   sets in themes and raw number count, while already overlapping in\n   tangible ways with V and Depths respectively, so sharing potential\n   subvault contents with the other branches helps expand the amount\n   of monsters a Necropolis can use when placing three vaults per\n   visit.\n\n   * (While this results in some very non-undead ghost vaults for Crypt,\n      that branch getting access as Depths has to the vast majority of\n      all ghost vaults options feels entirely appropriate.)\n\n * A variety of newer ghost vaults use very... novel runed door\n   arrangements. None of them are really much worse than what has been\n   heavily established by door_vault, though, and they present some\n   less singular approaches compared to single boxes with one small\n   runed door entrance, so they should be fine.\n\n * One vault (gammafunk_gnarly_gnolls) was too large to fit in Necropolis\n   subvault sizes and has had its ghost removed, while another vault\n   (nicolae_yredelemnul_ghost_church) also has had its ghost removed.\n   Ziggurats still keep their access to player ghosts also.\n\n * (Runed door and transporter vaults not reliant on player ghosts have\n    not been touched. A large focus of this project was inherently focused\n    on how player ghosts as a minimum of vault contents can be very\n    notably dangerous in a fashion that encourages delays, and there were\n    substantially more ghost vault appearances than other such runed door\n    or transporter vault appearances due to their flat chance each floor.)",
