      "message": "Some banishment + Doom Xom adjustments (adelrune)\n\n* After the large refactoring of 6874458, one of the enum entries in the\n  vector list of Xom's potential actions was filled with a function\n  instead: xom_maybe_reverts_banishment. Due to being assembled as an\n  enum at the start of loading up Crawl, this meant that Xom lost the\n  capability to banish players entirely unless they started the game\n  at the valid true banishment XL (>=6 with wrath, >=9 without). This\n  should fix this up to re-enable Xom-sourced banishment for Xom\n  worshippers (at an even rarer chance than previously), with slightly\n  more likeliness of seeing pseudo-banishment as chance compensation.\n  (There are some dev concerns of those XLs being spoilery magic numbers,\n  but nobody ever needs to fully understand Xom in many other aspects,\n  scaling Xom's threat level versus one's XL in other ways has succeeded\n  heavily in making them more fun and popular in de-emphasizing\n  unavoidable deaths, and pacifist Xom runs to avoid gaining XP are\n  decidedly impractical anyway).\n\n* Through the simplest solution of duplicating an entry and giving it\n  some long documentation for such, Xom is now slightly more likely to\n  apply Doom to the undead even more than they otherwise are for missing\n  both drain and mutation effects. While there are further reworks to\n  Xom still planned that should completely remove Xomscumming concerns\n  entirely, this still seems fine for now both in terms of letting undead\n  Xom worshippers see a reasonably-varied strategic damage system and\n  in terms of mostly threatening scumming strategies (since the Xom Doom\n  effect can't directly give banes without reaching boredom or wrath).\n\n(While I'm here, I've also renamed the debug-side \"bad mutations\" effect\nto the more accurate \"random mutations\", to help those reading the wizmode\nXom debug output. It's a little inaccurate- there's a bad mutation\nguaranteed only if one's in wrath- but it should be less confusing than\nimplying Xom's raw bad mutation rate is that particularly high.)",

The weight of their cutting from Depths is given to the\nother harmless Depths lava monster choices, fire elementals and molten\ngargoyles, which also are unlikely to do much at the depth but which\nprovide some less-comically-weak variety versus the full Snake\nsalamander selection Depths uses.\n\nMeanwhile, in a place that could always use more variety, I'm putting a\nvery tiny amount of fire bats to spawn in D:7-15, in the same depth as\nwhen lava snakes start spawning and two floors past when the somewhat\ncomparable ice beast spawns (which have better AC and HP + rPois, but\nworse speed). A fiery monster has been conspicuously missing from D for a\nlong while (outside of crimson imps, cut in 60f854e), and these can\neasily fulfill such in the branch where we already prominently use bats\nat a time where their statlines can actually be meaningfully relevant. It\ndoes lower the novelty of Volcanoes very slightly, but those have more\nthan enough monster set options that I'm not nearly as concerned about\nthose as I've been with the earliest portals.",

This caused them to to receive attacks while dead,\nwhich usually didn't matter as most of the effects from the attacks were\ncleaned up when reviving. However, not all effects are cleared on\nreviving and you do end up with messages in the message log that don't\nmake a log of sense for a dead character. Instead, count felids that are\npending revival as dead and fix up any of the checks that should still\naffect them (or a monster) when pending revival.\n\nFixes #4845",

      "message": "art: Make exclusions more readable\n\nAs someone that is partially colorblind, exclusions were very difficult\nfor me to read when placed over certain tiles. Shoals was the biggest\nculprit since the exclusions are hard to make out on top of sand and\nshallow/deep sea water tiles. Exclusions were also very difficult to see\nwhen placed over lava tiles. To address this, exclusions were given a\ntransparent black outline and a central white gradient.\n\nExclusion tiles connected with each other in a way that made it\ndifficult to see where the center of a tile was, since the corners had\nthe same crisscross pattern as the centers. I've seperated the corners\nso they are no longer connected. It's possible this might be more of an\nissue with the background tiles not having clear edges in some cases but\nthis at least makes excluded zones easier to quickly evaluate.\n\n[Committer's notes: I've tweaked the tiles in rypofalem's PR a bit to try\nto help them stand out more in areas with red backgrounds like Volcano,\nand edited the above commit message accordingly. If anyone reading this\nhas further suggestions or graphical tweaks to help colourblind folks,\nthey're always welcome.\n\nCloses #4880.]",

We\ncan't display the proper default plus at that point because the real\nitem hasn't been created yet.\n\nUse DESC_DBNAME instead, which doesn't have articles, quantities, or\nenchantments. You'll still have to pick up a ring of slaying created\nvia &o= and \"slay\" to see what its default plus is, but at least the\ndummy item created and displayed beforehand will no longer display an\ninaccurate plus of zero.\n\nCloses #4886.",

      "message": "Remove a netted monster blink check\n\nSince 2e68b5db91 (2014), monsters with SPELL_BLINK have had a 1/15 chance\nto cast blink instead of their other spells if caught in a net/web. This\nhad minimal impact on monster behavior, so here we simplify it out.\n\n(These mons will still try to cast blink while netted, but using their\notherwise-normal weighting.)\n\nI did consider approaching this from the opposite direction, and instead\n*increasing* the chance while expanding these escape spells to include\nthings beyond blink, but the end result of that would have been that\nplayers with nets would need to be much more aware of the specifics of the\nspellsets their net targets. This expected UX of incentivizing players\nto press xv before huckin' nets seems like it would make for worse\ngameplay, so I'm not doing that.",

      "message": "Remove a no longer needed tile cache\n\nWe had a cache for tiles of squares in view and another one for all\nother tiles. This allowed us to easily set tiles to unseen as they\nexited view in the Labyrinth branch by never writing them to the out of\nview tile cache (Labyrinth no longer exists), replace mcache reference\ntiles for monsters out of view with generic ones (but the bug that\ncaused us to do this is gone and we no longer do this), and support the\nclean_map option (which no longer exists). As none of these reasons for\nkeeping the two separate caches exist anymore it should be fine to just\nuse one cache for all tiles.\n\nThe cache for tiles in view stored tiles within a radius of 8 from the\nplayer and was indexed with coordinates that were relative to the\nplayer. This meant it would become invalid after the player moved if it\nwasn't updated and was sometimes leading to a crash in webtiles when\ndrawing parchments. Using a single cache indexed by grid coordinates\nshould fix this.",

However, the localtiles\nlist was missing a lot of entries and there were some minor differences\nwhere one of the lists had an incorrect value.\n\nThe reason for the missing values in the localtiles list is that it had\na default value and you couldn't tell if this value resulted in bad\nspacing between the icons without having multiple icons on a monster so\nit was often missed when adding a status icon. Webtiles on the other\nhand just doesn't show a status icon if it doesn't have a width for it\nwhich resulted in widths being added to its list when it was noticed\nthat the status icon wasn't showing up in webtiles.\n\nTo fix these problems, move the list of status icon widths to a text\nfile and generate the javascript and c++ lists from this. Also, give an\nerror message in the message log when trying to draw a status icon\nwithout a width in localtiles. This should allow testing a new status\nicon in either web or local tiles and have it just work in the other.",

      "message": "Yet more catch-up vault review\n\n * Another line-compressing simplification function has been added to\n   vault.lua and spread around, `single_cloud(_G, glyph, cloud, fade)`,\n   which provides two different settings for a cloud generator that never\n   leaves the one spot and is relatively consistent at being always or\n   nearly always present.\n\n * Pre-lair Necropolis subvaults using generic D enemies now heavily\n   specify the majority of their contents. While this was done for the\n   sake of rock fish escaping, it also avoids a few other annoyances,\n   like the optimality of checking for the slim chance of early unseen\n   horrors if one can identify subvaults as themeless, or moving around to\n   try and make efreet fire trails kill other monsters before engaging a\n   given subvault. (It may be reasonable to further investigate preventing\n   e.g. all wall-walking monsters from spawning in Necropolis entirely, as\n   the only real troubled area regarding explicitly optional sections such\n   behaviour can break, but this should function fine enough for now and\n   is needed to handle those other cases.)\n\n * Trove magic item handling now accomodates Djinn properly to exclude\n   books and nonfunctional orb types, and also allow one to get a fair bit\n   more orb randart type variety than previously. This somewhat addresses\n   #4860, though that issue also brings up heavy armour trove drops for\n   mages that are too impractical to assess versus stats / skills /\n   species beyond what acquirement and trove_ego_gen_armour already tries\n   to handle.\n\n * nicolae_gauntlet_exit_dead_adventurers no longer uses delayed_decay\n   arrangements for its skeletons as was made unnecessary by 7d43067.\n   A small amount of its species have been also swapped around to use\n   player species not often seen in the Dungeon, to try to emphasize\n   it more as using player adventurers rather than just some random\n   dead people.",

The code determining this was both buggy and\novercomplex for no good reason; it was only being called in one place.\n\nHere we simplify this by removing the notion of Vehumet supported schools\nentirely: If a spell returns true from `vehumet_supports_spell()`, we now\nassume that whatever schools it uses are destructive enough to be\naccounted for when checking Vehumet spell gift weights.\n\nIn practice, the difference here is that now Forgecraft spells with\nspflag::destructive will show up as Vehumet gifts more frequently, as\ntheir gifting weights will no longer return 0.\n\n(We do retain the averaged school weighting from 71ebbbb606 here.)",
