      "message": "Change Cloak of the Thief's effect\n\nIt seems widely agreed these days that Cloak of the Thief's fog effect is\nnot only double-edged but perhaps actively bad. Sometimes it saves you, but\nmany other times it reduces your ability to use ?blinking without actually\nbenefitting you at all. Many experienced players think it may be worse than\na plain cloak and that feels like a sad place for an unrand to be.\n\nSo let's try something else entirely!\n\nInstead of any fog effect, Cloak of the Thief now provides noise\nsuppression while wearing it (equivalent to, and not stacking with, the\nmutation). Since this is a very powerful effect, I have also reduced the\nenchantment to +0 (and increased the slaying penalty to -3). The hope is\nthat this is more exciting than the cloak used to be without being\nunreasonable. (If I've overshot the numbers, they can always be changed)",

      "message": "Coglin Gizmos!\n\nWhile the latest incarnation of the coglin downside (no rings, but\nrF+/rC+ at xl 13) may be at a reasonable power level, there's been much\ninterest expressed in making this system a little more involved,\nrandomized, and 'exciting'. So here is an attempt at this which tries to\ncapture some very fun coglin flavour in the process:\n\nCoglins no longer gain fixed resists at xl 13, and in addition to being\nunable to wear rings, also cannot wear amulets. But in exchange, they\nget a one-time choice of 3 random 'gizmos' at xl 14 - randomized\nequipment designed to fill part of the role of the jewelry they replace.\n\nThe intent is that these gizmos are still overall a net downside\ncompared to normal jewelry slots (with the earlier power, flexibility,\nand lategame artifact possibilities those hold), but that they preserve\nsome of the choice and excitement of finding new items and deciding\nbetween them - and not always knowing what you're going to end up using\nat the start of the game. A downside that *feels* like an upside. After\nall, being fun should be one of the foremost criteria for a new\nspecies, right?\n\nThese gizmos are generated as follows:\n\nEach gizmo has exactly 1 'rare property' and 2 'common properties'.\n\nThere are 6 total common properties (rF+, rC+, rPois+rCorr, rElec, Will+,\nSlay+3) and the player is gauranteed to see all 6 of them each game - just\nin randomized combinations.\n\nThere are currently 7 different 'rare properties', of which the player\nwill be offered a random 3 each game - so that you *can't* know in\nadvance which you will be offered (nor rely on getting a specific one\neach game). Several of these draw from existing equipment properties and\nseveral are entirely new. I feel strongly that it helps the player\nfun-factor of the system a lot if some of what you get from gizmos\ndoesn't just feel like \"Jewelry, but less of it\" but rather contains\nsome *new* choices instead of old ones (even if they're overall less\npowerful).\n\nThe list of current rare properties is:\n\n1) Regen + RegenMP\n\n2) Repel Missiles + Clarity\n\n3) Rampage + Acrobat\n\n4) Gadgeteer:\n     30% faster evocable recharge rate and 30% chance not to consume a wand\n     charge on firing\n\n5) ManaRev:\n     RegenMP++ but *only* while fully Revved\n\n6) ParryRev:\n     AC+5 while fully Revved, along with a small chance to disarm an enemy\n     upon hitting them. (This does not do any damage, unlike Captain's\n     Cutlass's extremely significant damage, to be clear)\n\n7) AutoDazzle\n     Small chance to fire a non-damaging beam of blinding light at an enemy\n     whose attacks you dodge - even at range.\n\nThe idea is that different modifiers should appeal to different sorts of\ncharacters, and also that several of them actively lean into the main\ngimmick of coglins by synergizing directly with Rev and attacking.\n\nObviously the balance of all of these is provisional, but I think given\nplayer response to various previous downsides, it's important to try and\nsell the *fun* of this foremost. Numbers can be adjusted down as-needed\nafterward.\n\nI hope people enjoy them!\n\n(Credit to regret-index for the tilework, and multiple other devs for\ndesign discussion and suggestions)",

Amulet of Vitality is now a plain amulet\nwith 2 levels of ARTP_MANA_REGENERATION instead of being a RegenMP amulet\nthat was special-cased to count twice.\n\nAmulets of regeneration and magic regeneration used entirely different\nmethods to track whether the player was attuned to them or not, and this\nunifies them, as well as refactoring a whole lot of code related to this.\n(This also improves messaging a couple of cases, such as Amulet of Vitality\nimplying it doesn't work for Djinn at all when you first wear it). I also\nreduced some needless scanning of inventory artifact props whenever the\nplayer's regen ticks while they are already at full hp/mp.\n\nThere is one functional change here, which is that items which grant both\nhp and mp regeneration (currently ONLY the Amulet of Vitality) will no\nlonger provide either until BOTH of the player's hp and mp are full\nsimultaneously. This irks me a little, but it seems minor enough that all\nof the extra infrastructure required to avoid it (while still allowing\nmore than a single source of RegenMP to ever function at once) seems\nunnecessary.",

      "message": "Revamp Draconian breath weapons\n\nThere's been some desire to revamp how draconian breath weapons work for\na while now, so this is a serious attempt at doing so. The general idea is\nto make pressing the button less common (ie: avoid it being 'correct' to\nbreathe at the start of every latergame fight, even when the breath does\nvery little) while also making the breath effects flashier and more\nimpactful when you do.\n\nAll breath weapons can now store up to 3 charges, and are on an XP-based\nrecharge system. (You get 2 charges immediately upon hitting level 7 and\nupgraded saves above xl 7 will be given 3). All breaths have been adjusted\nsomewhat - with some being overhauled more significantly - both to be more\ndistinctive from each other and to scale better throughout the length of\nthe game.\n\nRed Draconians: Combustion Breath\n\nBorrowing functionality from old Explosive Bolt, Combusion Breath causes a\nfireball to strike every target in a line. It does less single target\ndamage than most breaths, but can do significant AoE damage if you line up\na good shot. (The user is immune to damage from these explosions).\n\nGreen Draconians: Noxious Breath\n\nVery similar to their old breath, but the clouds last longer (especially at\nhigher power) and it has a power-based chance to spawn additional clouds\nalong the sides of the main beam as you rise in xl.\n\nPale Draconians: Steam Breath\n\nAgain, very similar to their old breath, but the initial hit now does\nrelevant damage, and the density/duration of the steam clouds improves with\nxl. (Keep in mind, using it is now much less free than it used to be.)\n\nYellow Draconians: Caustic Breath\n\nFires a penetrating acid bolt that leaves acidic fog clouds on all\nunoccupied spaces it passes over. These are rarely seen clouds (which\nyellow draconians are conveniently immune to!). Early on, these can serve\nas obstructions to enemies, and later on a reliable damage source that few\nthings are immune to.\n\nBlack Draconians: Galvanic Breath\n\nFires a projectile that does electricity damage to all targets connected\nto what it hits - think of it as firing an arcjolt at a single (possibly\ndistant!) cluster of enemies. (This also refactors arcjolt code somewhat\nand improves its animation by no longer interrupting it wheneve the\nmessage log fills up)\n\nWhite Draconians: Glacial Breath\n\nFires a penetrating beam of cold which does the highest individual damage\nof any draconian breath and also turns anything it kills into durable\nblocks of ice for a little while. Good as both a direct damage solution and\nalso to create blockers in corridors or other chokepoints.\n\nPurple Draconians: Nullifying Breath\n\nFires a non-penetrating projectile that expands into a radius-2 explosion.\nIt dispels magical effects on targets hit (like before) and also inflicts\nsignificant amounts of antimagic - but its damage is quite poor compared\nto other damaging breaths. (The user is immune to their own breath.)\n\nGrey Draconians: Mud Breath\n\nFires a non-pentrating ball of mud which has knockback and leaves puddles\nof temporary mud around its destination. (Similar to Primal Wave, but\nmuddier). Grey draconians are now unaffected by mud.\n\nHaving long been the only draconian distinguished by having no breath at\nall, it felt a bit sad to leave them out of the fun.\n\nBreath weapon charges available are indicated by a status light (as well\nas in the ability menu, but after playtesting I felt it better if one\ndidn't feel the need to bring up the ability list repeatedly to check).\nAs draconian breath no longer has a breath cooldown (the limited charges\naccomplishes more than enough to prevent it from being spammed, and being\nable to burst some of the damaging breaths from time to time is a good\nthing, imo) there should be no risk of getting it confused with the old\n'Breath' status light (which is additionally renamed '-Breath')\n\nAll sorts of numbers here may need nudging in one direction or another,\n(recharge speed especially needs playfeel testing in both early and\nlategame) but I think this is a decent set of useful distinct effects to\nstart from.",

      "message": "Allow previewing EV change for armour in item descriptions\n\nThis is a much more complicated question than displaying AC changes was,\nsince EV depends on a complicated formula that hinges not only on the\nchange in ER between the two armour being compared, but also differences in\nstr/dex from properties on the two items.\n\nRather than try to duplicate the complex logic of _player_evasion() or\nparameterize every single aspect of it (which would be brittle and\nerror-prone if any aspect of gear properties ever changed), I have opted\nto 'simulate' the correct answer by internally equipping the item just long\nenough to calculate player EV while wearing it.\n\nAs this is done by directly manipulating equipment links, it should be\ninvisible and have no side-effects rewarding wielding/unwielding.\n\nOne complication is that Crawl's item system makes it literally impossible\nfor the player to equip (even internally) an item that isn't in their\ninventory. And since inventory is capped at a fixed size and might be full\n(and the player might be examining an item for a slot which is currently\nempty!), there is no normal way to gaurantee we have anywhere to put this\nitem, even temporarily.\n\nSo I have 'cheated' by adding an extra slot to you.inv beyond MAXPACK (the\nnormal cap). This should be invisible basically everywhere, and is not\nmarshalled (since it's only temp working space). This still makes me\nslightly nervous, but I have looked through as much code that directly\nmanipulates this array as I can without seeing a problem this will cause\n(other than one fixed by this commit itself), and I also see no other\nreasonable way to do this without overhauling item links entirely. Which,\nwhile theoretically nice, is wildly out of scope here.\n\nAs this process is still somewhat sketchy, I've tried to document the\ngotchas quite explicitly, where they exist. But I think the QoL improvement\nto players is well worth the hack.",

      "message": "Change how the Repel Missiles effect works\n\nThis is both a simplification and a rebalancing.\n\nCurrent, repel missiles works by reducing the to-hit roll of a missile by\na random amount from 0-100% of its current value (or 0-50% of its value if\nit's a penetrating beam). In effect, this acts a little like a multiplier\nof the defender's EV - it does almost nothing at low EV and its\neffectiveness directly rises with EV - but with different math.\n\nThis has several arguably bad effects:\n -The buff has little effect on enemies with mediocre EV (and there's been\n  a desire to make an rMsl aura enemy, who would currently accomplish\n  little when supporting many types of enemy)\n -The effect of the buff is *enormously* counteracted by EV reductions like\n  wand of roots (which used to grant something like a +2800% chance to hit\n  versus The Enchantress, as an extreme example). If enemies have rMsl, I\n  think you should *feel* it in the same way that you feel enemy rF when\n  you're attacking with fire\n -Scarves of repulsion were close to useless on many characters, but a lot\n  of players did not realize this and assumed they were still providing\n  meaningful bonuses to characters with no EV. This new system should make\n  that a lot clearer to explain, as well as make some itemization choices\n  viable that previously were not.\n\nThis changes rMsl to be a flat +EV versus missile attacks instead, and\noperates even if the target is incapacitated (the magic is still pushing\narrows away, even if the caster is asleep!) The old behaviour of being\nonly half as efffect against penetrating beams is removed also (SH already\noffers a means of attack avoidance that specifically is worse against\npenetrating beams).\n\nIn enemy hands, it should have a stronger effect on most enemies, and be\nmuch less negated by constriction (though constriction still helps a bunch\nin most cases!). In player hands, this is a buff if the player is below\n~18 EV and a nerf if the player is above that (which I think should make\nscarfs of repulsion more appealing to more characters and maybe make\nitemization decisions a little more diverse)\n\nNumbers can, of course, be adjusted (and the player/enemy bonus separated),\nbut I think it's fair that rMsl feel impactful against the type of thing it\nresists in a similar way that a pip of resistance would be against its.",

      "message": "Simplify and rebalance many things about Constriction\n\nThis commit significantly affects formulas for nearly every aspect of\nconstriction, both for and against both players and monsters. It includes\nbugfixes, simplifications, and deliberate rebalancing.\n\nNotable changes:\n\n1) Constriction damage no longer scales over time. This had already been\n   unknowingly broken for monster-applied constriction for a long time,\n   and now is removed for players as well. This simplifies some internals,\n   as well as making duration increases for player effects like /roots not\n   scale so non-linearly\n\n2) Constriction escape chance for players has been radically simplified.\n   The old formula was very hard to intuit odds from, but when I ran the\n   math, the player was overwhelmingly favored to escape most things by\n   the second attempt, and still most likely to escape on a first attempt.\n   Tentacled monstrosities were the notable exception, who were something\n   like 2.5 times as likely to hold onto you as the next-best constrictor.\n\n   Player escape is now independent of the constrictor's HD and is a flat\n   40%, 75%, 100% chance depending on attempts. (Despite being overwhelming\n   likely to escape most things by 2 attempts, there was still a long tail\n   that made it theoretically possible to fail many times in a row, and I\n   am not convinced this is worth preserving)\n\n   Monster escape chance still scales with constriction power (eg: evo for\n   /roots or spellpower for BVC) and now includes the monster's HD in this\n   formula - intended so that /roots can be stronger earlier game than it\n   currently is, while weakening the hold effect lategame without any\n   investment. (This also fixes a bug where /root hold power was based on\n   the player's xl....)\n\n3) Blinking and related effects now ALWAYS escape constriction, rather than\n   merely making a 'better' attempt at escape. (It was claimed that they\n   previously counted as '2 escape attempts', but even this was not really\n   correct - they were a single attempt that counted as if you'd already\n   made one.) In practice, ?blinking was extremely likely to work against\n   anything that wasn't a tmons, to the point that I think it felt\n   unsatisfying that sometimes it did not. Since constriction will be more\n   dangerous in various ways now, it feels fairer to allow this to be\n   reliable. (It also simplifies the code somewhat.)\n\n   Guaranteed escapes now get different messaging to hopefully make it\n   clearer that they work this way.\n\n4) Changed the EV penalty for constriction. Rather than a heavy size-based\n   multiplier for monsters and an ignorable -3 EV for players, it applies\n   a flat -10 EV to both. This should make that penalty actually matter\n   for players and reduce some of the most lopsided uses of the EV\n   reduction against enemies, while also simplifying.\n\n   (Monsters being constricted and monsters held in webs/nets previously\n   shared the same complex penalty. Now constriction applies before these,\n   but can stack. Webs are simplified to ignore monster size now also)\n\n5) Rebalanced damage/duration of most source of constriction in the game.\n\n   Enemy melee constriction damage is now randomized (it didn't used to be)\n   and somewhat higher. (Also displays on xv!).\n\n   Grasping Roots has a higher minimum duration but a lower maximum\n   (previously only the maximum scaled with power, resulting in duration\n   ranges like 2-21 turns). Damage is decreased (in compensation with being\n   harder to escape and penalizing EV more). If this results in defanging\n   Shambling Mangroves, they can be adjusted.\n    -While enemy BVC isn't used much yet, I am intending to leave it\n     actively into being a short-duration, higher-damage effect while roots\n     is a high-duration, lower-damage effect.\n\n   Player melee constriction is no longer based directly on player str\n   (25 str characters used to do 5x the damage of 5 str characters!), but\n   purely a function of XL.\n\n   Damage of all player sources increased somewhat, to compensate for no\n   longer scaling over time.\n\n   Wand of roots lasts longer and does more damage at low power.\n   (the old non-linear damage scaling from duration left it pretty mediocre\n   at low power)\n\n6) Because I expect melee constriction against the player to feel stronger\n   from most sources, I have reduced the chance to apply it on hit from\n   100% to 66%. This may or may not turn out to be necessary, but in\n   general I favour more impactful effects applied less often than mild\n   ones applied all the time.\n\n7) Better messages to differentiate roots/bvc wearing off versus being\n   escaped from.\n\nAs this affects balance of many things across many parts of the game, some\ntime to observe how it plays out will be needed, and I imagine other\nnumerical tweaks will happen subsequently. But I hope this is a better\nbaseline from which to work.",

Several of them are very weak as threats (fire\nvortices, ball lightnings), and several of them are essentially adding new\nmonsters that have to go over rigorous design criteria entirely seperate of\ntheir functionality for a spell- for example, we're almost certainly not\ngoing to make dryads or cactus giants anything besides glassed monsters in\na gimmick portal if every.\n\nThat said, Brom's Barrelling Boulder makes an extremely physical object\nthat, when made to not move as the default placement works, can reasonably\nfit in any number of vaults already placing stones, large rocks, crumbled\ncolumns, shafts, and so on looking for earthen decoration. The boulder has\na different tile when it's not rolling, and uses \"dbname:still_boulder\" for\na description when not moving. Do note that they should not be used for any\nmeaningful walls, however, since we've already got normal plants covering\nmost of that design space already.\n\nThe placeholder tile is an extreme edit of canofworms's Brom's spell icon.\n\nBy the way, new rule: no sokoban vaults.",

      "message": "New(?) monster: thermic dynamos, for Elf and vaults elsewhere\n\nThese new monsters are meant to provide another notable nonliving monster\nto Elf beyond the dancing weapons, as well as pick up the fire and ice\ntheme for former crystal bolts much more directly by being bejewelled\nmobile elemental turbines. They're meant to be a weaker glass cannon\ncompared to crystal guardians- swapping their notable AC, rElec+++,\nand a bit of spellpower for passable evasion, fast movement speed, and\ntwo-individually weaker hits of AF_FIRE + AF_COLD. Arguably they're also\na little reminscient of zephyrmancers, as low-AC bolt-bouncers in Elf:\non that front, they're much harder to kill in exchange for a far easier\nresistance and respecting more of AC. In exchange for their overall\nweaker or comparable state they're a bit more common in Elf and various\nvaults than crystal guardians were in V, occasionally banding in duos, and\nalso replace the latter's use in late D.\n\nTo help clarify their particular mechanics and to distance further from the\nold crystal theme, Crystal Bolt spell's dual-element possibilities have\nalso been split into two seperate spells of Rebounding Blaze and Rebounding\nChill, which are slightly-rescaled copies of Bolt of Fire and Bolt of Cold\naside from the wall bounce. I don't know if future uses might be found for\nthese spells or these monsters, but they give a little more variety past\nLair branches in conjunction with the change to V's crystal guardians.\n\nTheir placeholder tile is a mix of DD's old Enter the Abyss tile and\ncanofworms's old tile for the Staff of Battle (before that got orbified).\nThe spell icon tiles, like Crystal Bolt before them, mix together\nroctavian's Bolt of Fire, Bolt of Ice, and stone wall tiles.",

      "message": "C. guardians / echidnas: Crystal Bolt 🡲 Crystalizing Shot (PleasingFungus)\n\nWhile \"notably-resistant melee enemy with a ranged attack\" as an archetype\nfor monsters has a variety of reasonable manifestations as this point,\ncrystal guardians are a bit weird. The earthen theme they might brandish as\na monster made entirely of crystal instead focuses elsewhere, over to the\nconnection crystal walls have with bolts of cold and bolts of fire. That\nparticular mechanic's prominence has been mildly reduced over time, since\nwands lost both and spells lost the former, and there's been a little\nreduction of it versus other forms of it even on monsters (no more deep\nelf conjurers, removed off of necromancers and ancient liches). While it\nlets them fire through some other earthen and icy monsters, it's a bit\noff compared to more direct earth themes of raw damage with a side bit of\ncorrosion at most.\n\nSince Vitrify seems to have worked out relatively well as a dangerous\nhex to throw around, I'm making them fire off a short-range projectile\nshot that applies the status two thirds of the time it hits and deals\nany damage. Refined crystal monster making one as fragile as unrefined\ncrystal has a certain cruel logic to it, and it's one last reasonable\nvector to toss the effect around for a while now by being much more\nthreatening to the high-ac, low-ev characters than Fragile otherwise\npotentially threatens the reverse. It does do less damage on hit than the\ncrystal bolts did, since while it can't bolt-bounce it's inherently\nmultiplicative for other monsters too (like the mighting peacekeeper bands\nin V they show up in most games in, or the terror that Desolation tends to\nbe). To orient them towards their focus on melee here, they also get a few\ntweaks towards slightly less HP and AC but slightly more melee damage.\nThis also gives crystal echidnas the aforementioned Crystallizing Shot over\nCrystal Bolt. They're quite weak for extended and mostly meant to be\ngeneric elemental fodder for Dis, which isn't a terrible position, but as a\nmonster designated only for such late positioning they could do with a\nmechanic of any much note when they're otherwise a faster, weaker version\nof a monster already seen in V. Said vitrification should be terrifying in\nDis, which admittedly might warrant some adjustments on Dis a little later.\n\nThe Crystal Bolt spell hasn't been removed, as a one-off use of\nbolt-bouncing on an element besides lightning is a reasonable mechanical\nniche another monster could use with some renaming. The new Crystallizing\nShot spell tile uses both snw-0's LCS icon and Bloax's Corona icon.",

      "message": "Coglins: --Move, +-Rings & +Resist\n\n-Move was added to Coglins to add tactical variety, and to balance\nout their big upside (dual wielding) without making major and\nundesirable nerfs to skill aptitudes or HP. There were some upsides\nto -Move-on-action, and it might someday return in some other context,\nbut ultimately very few people enjoyed it - even with considerable\nwork put into UI improvements, it still broke flow.\n\nInstead, let's try doubling down on Coglins' 'no fast swap' gimmick\nand remove their ability to wear rings. (It'd interfere with their\nmagic exo-arms, see.) I'm generally not particularly fond of equipment\nrestrictions, since they reduce the fun of finding gear (one of the\njuciest parts of Crawl), but this is at least novel and has some\nother interesting interactions with the rest of the species.\n\nTo partially compensate for this downside later on, Coglins now gain\nrF+ rC+ at XL 13. We might or might not eventually replace this with\na choice between a few different 'upgrades'.\n\nMinor notes:\n- Coglins can still wear rings if they find the Macabre Finger\n  Necklace. This is very silly and the UI isn't great, but unrands\n  are allowed to be silly.\n- Possibly we should remove rings from the % screen rather than\n  showing them as 'unavailable'.",
