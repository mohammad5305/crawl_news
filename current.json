      "message": "Revise trove contents into new themed locales\n\nThe actualy rewards within Trove are mostly severely focused and uneven,\ndue to all but a few vaults focusing on very singular item categories- all\nweapons, all armour, all jewellery, various potions, or various scrolls,\nalongside a small number mixing spellbooks and magic staves. Even the ones\nthat can contain multiple categories can struggle due to the average\nquality of placing only a few of some categories (like weapons) being\nrelatively low. This makes it very difficult to evaluate what the average\nquality of troves should be in order to properly set the costs to enter\nthem. They are also mostly highly-forgettable boxes of items all in a\nsingular pile, without the decorations introduced throughout much of the\nrest of the game, nor any particular themes, which is a somewhat lacking\nstate of affairs for one of the very few noncombat zones in the game\n(compare to e.g. the extreme number of Temple layouts or Bazaar\ncustomers added in e151113.)\n\nThis commit revamps a decent number of trove layouts and grants them new\nthemes plus names dedicated to spell namesakes and unrands, a space which\nhas made Wizlabs be one of the most memorable and beloved set of portals\nin the game. (It also gets in a handful of names that would be very\ndifficult to make Wizlabs for with the current sprawl of Wizlabs without\nsubstantially more lategame monster options; this isn't meant to be a hard\ncap on returning to any of those eventually, and to those ends there is\na single overlap between troves and wizlabs already present). They also\nhave a rather large set of lua functions distributing their themes across\na variety of different item categories then tailored to species limits,\ngod restrictions, and player skills, which should make it so every trove\nhas a relatively more stable floor and ceiling of item quality. (They also\nhave less items overall- a hard focus on 12 items compared to the prior\n16- between said tailoring of average quality and since the trove costs\nrevamp in 0288ec2 allows recklessly picking up troves on sight in\nexchange for significant downsides.)\n\nIt'd take an excessively long amount of words to outline just exactly\nwhat each new trove may contain, but to list and summarize each of them\nin brief as an introductory teaser:\n\n * Ozocubu's Refridgerator:\n  - freezing weapons, rC+ gear, and Ice Magic\n * The Storm Queen's Palace Crash Site:\n  - electric weapons, rElec gear and shields, and Air Magic\n * Leda's Sunken Stockpile\n  - heavy weapons, *Slow or ponderous gear, and Earth Magic\n * The Name-Rending Infernalists' Reservoir\n  - flaming weapons, rF or Harm gear, and Fire Magic\n * Eringya's Secret Bog\n  - spectral weapons, rPois gear, and Alchemy or Summoning\n * Rutra's Hidden Sanctum\n  - venomous weapons, Stealth or +Inv gear, and Hexes\n * The Dread Knight's Derelict Charpel\n  - draining or reaping weapons, Will+ or +Slay gear, and manuals\n * The First Justicar's Armoury\n  - holy wrath weapons, rN gear, and regeneration amulets\n * The Octopus King's Forgotten Garden\n  - enough jewellery and armour to exactly match octopode slots,\n * The Lost Hoard of Erebora\n  - dragon scales, talismans, hat randarts, and elemental magic\n * a devouring Rift(!)\n  - distortion and chaos weapons, random armour, and Translocations\n * an orange crystal hatchery(?)\n  - antimagic weapons, Int or Will+ gear, Earth Magic and Summoning\n\nIf it turns out the overall item quality ends up feeling too high relative\nto rolling troves or not in a game, the total item count can be reduced a\nlittle, or the various consumables keyed to each of these troves can\nreplace some of the equipment. As is, I'd like to assess how well the\ntrove cost changes work out and how well the item mixes plus\nskill-weighting feel in practice first. There are also still spaces for\nconjoining trove themes, if other people want to submit additions to this\ntrove set in the future, other spells and unrands help pin down some\ncurrently-absent themes, or more item types are added overall.\n\n(This commit also revises the flavour of the Robe of Night to not mention\na real-world goddess in the context of Crawl's highly established\npantheon, adds a proper tilerim to the storm bow, and also adds a new\ndecorative floor option of inaccessible alcoholic drinks with a tile\nbased off of CC0 assets by Jetrel.)",

They\nuse an encased-relief style referring to other tiles throughout the game,\nwhich I'd like to deploy to the rest of Zot eventually (with a different\nset each floor both matching the current Zot floor colour schemas and\nvarious different rune branches throughout the game).

      "message": "New Xom effect: small amounts of Doom\n\nWhile Xom recieved quite a large number of different good and bad effects\nin the past two versions, one of the various lingering problems with\nvariety in Xom's actions is a lack of effects that can be done with no\nvisible monsters. In particular, this makes random teleport effects\nvery common while resting or travelling, which while successfully and\niconically disruptive to normal gameplay, is also one that encourages\ntedious optimization (in retreating up staircases) while failing to\ndiscourage other tedious optimization (in Xomscumming by waiting around\nfor net higher benefits). More meaningful effects that can be done outside\nof combat would somewhat help.\n\nAs such, I am removing about 10% of the weight on teleportation to instead\nlet Xom increment up one's Doom at the same current likeliness of draining.\nThe effect mostly just increments up one's Doom by 15 to 25% if below 50%\nDoom, and increments half that much if above 50% Doom and neither boredom\nnor wrath are involved. Xom won't actually actively choose to inflict\nenough Doom to make it above the 50% threshold unless they're bored or\nwrathful, however, so this shouldn't produce Banes unless one is dawdling,\nXom-scumming, or facing particularly many Doom-inflicting enemies while\nalso getting somewhat unlucky. As such, this should thus not actually make\nXom worship much actively worse outside of poor luck versus Orbs of\nEntropy or being too weak to handle given draugr, but it should still help\nreduce the overall teleportation roulette amounts by enough to help a bit.",

      "message": "Vault review, post-doom edition\n\nWith orbs of winter, orbs of entropy, and draugr handled in prior commits,\nthis vault review mostly concerns drudes, ravens, and zykzyls, plus the\nchanges to neqoxecs, cacodemons, and shining eyes.\n\nWorthy of note:\n\n * Drudes have limited to being placed in a few early tier-5 demon vaults,\n   some but not all of which were old quasit placements.\n\n * Ravens have mostly been placed rarely in Lair vaults using most of the\n   total Lair monster pool, as well as outside the two most unholy Lair\n   endvaults as feels vaguely appropriate for their unlucky themes.\n\n * Neqoxecs and cacodemons get to be slightly more common now that the\n   former's mutations are transient and the latter has to land multiple\n   hits with a spell to inflict a direct long-lasting effect. Zykzyls,\n   on the other hand, have been placed in only a couple of the former\n   cacodemon locations as is thematically appropriate and are fairly more\n   uncommon than cacodemons in vaults overall, due to neither digging nor\n   being in Makhleb's servant list.\n\n * Mnoleg's level swaps out cacodemons for zykzyls to retain the mutation\n   theme, and loses shadow demons entirely for now; while it's both funny\n   and highly appropriate for the summoning-based fixed Pan lord to have\n   summoners summoning more summoners, attaching it to the very sudden\n   strategic damage of Malmutate casts is awkward. Shadow demons have been\n   moved to always appear in Gloorx Vloq's level instead (who still has\n   Summon Executioners and loose shadowy themes), to experiment a little\n   with top-tier draugr both being far less common than malmutation in the\n   level as well as to slightly lower said draugr placement.\n\n * Other incidental pieces of this vault review include keeping eels out\n   of flame cloud generators behind glass, moving a Swamp-themed vault out\n   of Snake and into Depths, fixing teleports for one closet and one\n   Necropolis ghost subvault, and a nerf of a D:2 out-of-depths vault.",

      "message": "New monster: screaming refractions, for the Abyss\n\nInjury Mirror on monsters appearing in many circumstances is somewhat\nawkward, as it being cast near the start of a battle can prompt simply\nresetting the encounter or kiting until one can wait on the Injury\nMirror cooldown instead. Its former usage on death knights somewhat was\nhelped by both attacks of opportunity and their bands, but their capacity\nto otherwise kill a player at range was rather low. There are, however, a\nfew branches where regular respawns and unstable terrain can make it\nawkward to try and ignore the monster, which can always do with more\nunique monsters.\n\nThese new flying corporeal undead, \"screaming refractions\", are\ncrystalline Abyss monsters that pick up the Injury Mirror spell for an\nunholy-ish branch that both doesn't have a lot of unique undead tied into\nits distinct flavour as well as another crystal monster for one of the\nbranches with the most crystal in the game. Somewhat close to a phantasmal\nwarrior stats with better defenses and less melee damage, they also cast\nLee's Rapid Deconstruction to do some damage at range (if mostly limited\ntp already stronger species or low-xl characters), as well as making\nextreme amounts of noise as is quite dangerous in the Abyss if otherwise\nignored (in a fashion avoidable as usual with careful moving around\nwalls). (It could possibly also use other noise-based mechanics, if those\nend up getting sufficient homes in the future....)\n\nIt appears relatively uncommonly in the middle of Abyss depths and a few\nvaults thereof, trimming out some weight from various unholy monsters\nalready shared throughout the rest of the game. It could also work for\nfuture weird portals with other sorts of active clock gimmicks, if they\ncan match the flavour of it.\n\nThe tile is composited from Denzi's deep elf fighter and old tormentor\ntile, mixed with roctavian's worker ant and soldier ant tiles.",

      "message": "Revise death knights and move them deeper\n\nThe history of monster death knights of Yredelemnul is quite long and\nquite strange, originating from the failed Dwarven Halls branch (8d12bfa)\nas a deep dwarf monster with Drain Life to offset the inability to heal,\nplus their one-currently-surviving gimmick of Pain / Injury Mirror that\nmostly made Zigs much slower. They lost their initial Summon Undead\nfaux-recall spell in 083e7ed, got any actual stats and Crypt placement\nin abfeb2e and its follow-ups, lost their dwarvish nature in 6cf6886,\nwere merged with unborn in 01b03bd to gain Haunt, then lost Haunt and\nwere moved earlier in 0464229. They've struggled to entirely retain much\nof a gimmick beyond a living monster with a non-derived-undead band and\nthe tedious-in-normal-play Injury Mirror buff, which was removed in the\nfirst major rework of Yredelemnul (b4513a3), and the second rework of that\ngod gave players rather different passives and active abilities (18fcfa0).\nAs such, they're strange stragglers of weird mechanics in a distant past.\n\nUpdating these death knights and adjusting their placement has multiple\npurposes. Aside from actually aligning them with the player god fairly\nmore than currently, it can also reduce our reliance on necromancer\nmonsters throughout four branches and a portal throughout the whole game,\ncan help further seperate the monster overlap between late D versus Vaults\nversus Depths, and help nudge up Crypt slightly more in threat level to\nmake it less uneven and less of a place to potentially work off strategic\ndamage.\n\nThis commit bumps up the stats and equipment of death knights a bit,\n(including a 50% for the weapon to be draining branded), gives them a\nradius-3 umbra they can ignore the penalties of, and grants access to Hurl\nTorchlight (implemented for monsters in 2ecfa2a), which should be pretty\nunique for monsters as simultaneous buffing and damage in one action.\nTheir Crypt bands have also been nudged further up the Yred Torch summons\npool, no longer using plain wraiths and instead a small chance of\njiangshi). In exchange, they lose access to Injury Mirror, slated to be\nadded to a different monster that can make walking away more relevant\nbeyond just attacks of opportunity). This does make them a little\ndetrimental to other monsters they may find outside their bands, but the\numbra effect is minimal in practice and it's cute enough to have unholy\nmonsters be somewhat dangerously reckless (c.f. Ghostly Sacrifice,\noccultists fireballing themselves.)\n\nThey're no longer placed in late D, with most of their weight distributed\nto monsters that could use slightly more common placement at a time where\nthey're relevant in threat level, and the chance for a wraith band has\ninstead been given to directly freezing wraiths (only when placed in late\nD) as a means of making them be less straightforward melee monsters also\nextended possibly too far across the game as stands. In exchange, they now\nplace in V completely replacing the current sparing necromancer monster\nplacement there, with a different band of mostly draugr with a chance for\nanother death knight; this is both meant to into the militarized humanoid\nflavour of Vaults, the treasure-guarding flavour of draugr, and to make\nderived undead bands be tangibly different between V and Depths. This is\nstill quite rare placement in V; I'd like to see how people feel about\ndraugr as melee-range non-instant strategic damage with harmless floors\nand high ceilings in general before pushing them much higher, especially\nin contrast to the removal of prior annoyances in regular-branch Injury\nMirror.",

It even announces the effect so that\nplayers can realize it helped them!\n\nI'm not sure exactly how generous this is in practice, since it excludes\nmonster items and shops (which are a large chunk of items one cares about),\nbut numbers are easily adjustable.

      "message": "Randomize which Orb of Element guards Zot each game\n\nOrbs of Fire are one of the most iconic enemies in all of Crawl - fast,\nterrifying, and an overwhelming source of fire damage. So much so that\ntheir mere presence makes players value rF+ over any other resist. This\nsort of strategic consideration can be interesting, but it can sometimes\nalso makes things feel a little lopsided (with many resists considered\nless appealing entirely *because* there are no endgame users of it that\nare similarly scary). Alternate orb types have been a recurring player\nsuggestion, and rotating enemy content between seeds has been very\nsuccessful with S-branch rotation for many years, so this is an attempt to\nsee if doing so in a limited way for Zot could introduce some more\ninteresting variation in itemization decisions that players make, while\nalso presenting novel forms of challenge.\n\nEach game, Zot is populated by *exactly one* of Orbs of\nFire/Winter/Entropy. Which type will appear there is announced to the\nplayer in advance via statues found outside of Temple (and also outside\nthe entrance to Zot). This is so that the player is forewarned before\nmaking run-long itemization decisions, such as what to spend ?ea scrolls\non (or especially Coglin gizmo choice). Once the player has seen the\nstatues in question, this information is also shown on the dungeon\noverview screen (ctrl+O) just in case they may have missed it or\nforgotten.\n\nZot vaults wanting to place whichever orb type was chosen this seed can\nuse 'orb of appropriateness' and the lua function dgn.zot_orb_type() can\nbe used to handle vetos/versioning for vaults that want to more\nspecifically match a given type of orb.\n\nZiggurats are allowed to use all 3 orb types in a single seed (as they\nalready place S-branch monsters from branches that weren't generated), but\nthe rest of the game should restrict itself to orbs of appropriateness.\n\nHopefully this will add a little bit of extra variety to runs without too\nheavily disrupting the fundamental Zot experience.\n\n(Vault review done by regret-index)\n\n-------\n\nOrb statue tiles made by regret-index, composited from LemurRobot's orb\nof winter and orb of entropy submissions, CC0 pixel art orbs by flowly\nand idylwilds, Sastreii's salamander firebrand and eye simulacrum tiles,\nand the statue plinths made by ontoclasm.",

      "message": "Experimental Zot:5 change: Boundless Tesseracts\n\nWhile the Zot:5 endvault is an iconic and often tense challenge, there have\nbeen some repeated sentiments over the years that the best (or, at least,\na compelling) way to handle it is through a slow and tedious process:\nstaying a safe distance away and shouting for an incredibly long time to\nvery slowly lure monsters out of the vault where they can be pulled back to\nthe stairs or otherwise dealt with individually.\n\nThis commit attempts to address this issue by applying forward time\npressure in a relatively transparent and urgent way (while making pulling\nthings individually back to the stairs a little less guaranteed to be\nsafe). Each lung of the endvault now contains a Boundless Tesseract, which\nis essentially a form of monster generator. So long as they are active,\nrandom floor-appropriate monsters will periodically spawn across the floor.\nThis is slow at first, but steadily increases in speed the longer the\ntesseracts remain alive. This should make ultra-slow strategies inadequate\nand push players to be a little more aggressive with making their way into\nthe vault (while still being gentle enough initially that it does not\nheavily disrupt normal strategies).\n\nWhen tesseracts first 'wake up' (typically from nearby noise), they will\nreveal and announce themselves to the player. Killing either tesseract will\nalso destroy the other (so the player only needs to enter *a* lung, not\nboth of them.). Finally, the tesseracts come with a 'pool' of XP to help\nmake their spawns feel less unpleasant while still removing any farming\nincentives: the monsters spawned by tesseracts initially give XP normally\nat first, but eventually become unrewarding if the player is slow enough.\nKilling the tesseract rewards all remaining XP in the pool, so there is no\nreason to delay doing so. This XP should hopefully be large enough that\naverage play will not run into many (or any) unrewarding monsters.\n\nThe spawn rate is very provisional at the moment, pending player testing.\n\n(Tile credit goes to regret-index)",

      "message": "Make Zot/orbrun fuzz blinking scroll destinations\n\nZot has gone through many variations of translocations restrictions in\npast; for a while, ?blinking were reduced to purely random blink, which was\njustifiably considered too heavy-handed by making a key consumable nearly\nuseless. However, the sheer power of ?blinking when the player no longer\nhas any reason to conserve them sometimes results in the finale being more\nanticlimactic than one would like - skipping past otherwise tricky\nencounters, easily fleeing any Pan lord, using them as instant teleports\nvia any nearby teleport trap, etc. It feels like the finale might be a\nlittle more interesting if a similar restriction was applied to them that\nis already applied to ?tele - where they are still powerful, but just a bit\nless reliable.\n\nThis introduces a 2 tile fuzz to ?blinking when used in Zot or on the\norbrun - functionally identical targeting to how the barachi Hop ability\nalready works (though capable of reaching to the edge of LoS). This isn't\na terribly strong restriction, but might do just enough to add a little\nextra spice without feeling like the ?blinking a character has saved for\nthe end of the game weren't worth it.",

      "message": "Revamp Trove fees using some new options\n\nTroves are a theoretically exciting thing, and asking the player to\nsacrifice something in exchange for a random reward can be interesting\ngameplay, but many of the trove fees are troubled in practice.\n\nVital consumables are often too valuable for players to consider it\nequitable to sacrifice them for an unknown reward, but more tricky is the\nfact that the quantities asked for will in some cases exceed *how many of\nthose items generate for the player in the entire game*. Asking the player\nto increase their challenge is one thing, but giving them tasks they cannot\ncomplete (and might barely be worth it, even if they could) is\nunsatisfying. And on the other end, options like 'item in a shop' are often\njust \"Gold (which will eventually be free), but complicated.\"\n\nInstead, let's trim down the current options to focus on ones that are more\ninteresting, and give significant weight over to a new press-your-luck\noption in the form of Banes - something the player can *always* pay, but\nwhich still represents an immediate new threat to them.\n\n-50% of Troves now ask the player to accept a pre-announced bane in order\n to enter. (The details of the bane are viewable when the portal is\n examined and I've excluded some of the more situational ones from the list\n of possibilities.)\n-12.5% are piety-sacrifice troves (now using Ostracism instead, so that\n they function with more gods than before).\n-~6.2% inflict heavy Draining on the player.\n-~17% are split between Abyss/Slimy Rune and Horn of Geryone\n-~4% require 2 acquirement scrolls\n-~4% ask for an enchanted demon weapon (though any type will now suffice)\n-~6% ask for enchanted dragon armour (with deeper types being rarer)\n\nThese numbers are subject to change in future (to be honest, I'm not sure\nif the enchanted dragon armour is terrible interesting to keep, among the\nother possibilities).\n\nA subsequent commit will heavily revamp the *contents* of Troves as well.",

      "message": "Revamp unsafe potion/scroll mutations\n\nThe -potion/-scroll chance mutations are widely seen as the worst bad\nmutations one can get (scrolls, especially). Even though they are usually\ninactive, the *possibility* that the player could be denied access to\ntheir most critical escape tools (such as ?blinking) in a crisis tends to\nmake them cure-on-sight. And in my opinion, this combination of 'usually\ndoesn't do anything, except when it abruptly results in your death' is\nunsatisfying. So let's try experimentally flipping these mutations around.\n\nThese mutations now reliably block potions/scrolls in combat while the\nplayer is *healthy* and become inactive while they are significantly\ninjured. This means that the player can always count on their emergency\ntools being available when near death, but will have to plan around not\nhaving access to them ahead of time - like preemptive ?tele or !haste. The\nHP threshold is currently 65%/40% of max HP, based on the mutation level.\nThe blocking is not active outside of combat (to prevent interfering with\nstrategic consumables), but has a 6 turn lag time to wear off after\nencountering enemies (so that ducking around a corner doesn't immediately\nbreak it.) It's possible one or both of these numbers bear further\nadjustment, but let's see how this plays for now.\n\n(Level 2 of these mutations are currently also used as Ru sacrifices. I am\nunsure if the piety value of those should be adjusted.)",

      "message": "Rework many things about contam formulas\n\nMany aspects of the formulas underpinning magic contamination have not\nbeen changed in a very long time and had aspects which were clearly\nancient/vestigial or even misleading. The maximal amount of contam the\ngame tracks (and even had messages for) was wildly unobtainable outside\nof deliberate wizmode actions, contam explosions did an incredible\nirrelevant amount of damage (3d5 AC-checking damage at 11,000 contam,\nwhich was more than twice the level where mutations) and yet scaled\nalmost without limit (theoretically allowing screen-sized explosions\ndoing 3d125 damage) and checked random resistances (with no indication\nthey did this).\n\nMore importantly, the difference in threat posed by 'barely yellow'\nversus 'deeply yellow' contam was enormous: ~3% chance of one mutation\nversus 62% chance of 2 + 13% chance of 3 - or approximately 60 times as\nmany average mutations! Given plans to make use of hostile contam in a\nfew more contexts, I feel this degree of ambiguity is far too large.\n\nMoreover, while setting the current threshold for lightgrey contam at\n'the next irradiate is potentially unsafe' was a useful QoL feature for\nthat spell, this critical fact is not actually conveyed anywhere in-game\n(and thus depends upon community knowledge alone) *and* is generally\nincompatible with there ever being a second spell using a\ndifferently-sized contam cost (of which some have been proposed).\n\nSo this commit reworks most contam-related formulas in an attempt to\nclarify, simplify, and make suitable for future projects.\n\n-Contam has been rescaled internally. 1000 is now the start of yellow,\n 2000 the start of red, and 3000 the absolute cap.\n-Contam decays faster, but does not start to decay until 7 turns have\n passed since contam was last gained.\n-Low yellow is somewhat more dangerous than before and the difference\n between low/high has been narrowed. Very high levels of contam are worse\n than before (the mid range is similar to the prior state).\n-Being invisible no longer prevents all contam decay.\n-Evoking a scarf of invisibility no longer gives a tiny bit of contam (it\n was largely irrelevant, requiring 6 consecutive uses to hit yellow)\n-Contam explosions are possible at lower levels of contam than before, do\n significantly more damage (and ignore the player's AC), are non-elemental,\n and their base damage is based on the player's XL rather than the amount\n of contam. Yellow-tier explosions are radius 1, red are radius 2 and do\n more damage than yellow.\n-Contam mutations no longer have a 50% chance to ignore rMut (along with a\n few other narrow interactions with mutation conflicts due to counting as\n 'forced'). This seems unnecessary, with rMut being both weaker and far\n rarer than when this system was first designed.\n-Contam is now listed as a percentage on the UI, while contaminated (near\n the Doom indicator). Yellow is 100% (ie: the start of actual negative\n gameplay effects), red is 200%, and the cap is 300%. While the specific\n number is admittedly unimportant for minor contam, it helps make the\n difference between low/high transparent to the player, and critically:\n allows contam-costing spells to be transparent about what their risks\n are in the current moment.\n-Contam is only shown on the status line once you have enough for it to\n have gameplay impact (ie: yellow or worse).\n\nAll contam-inflicting things have been adjusted in light of these changes.\nMiscast contam was simply divided by 5 (ie: exactly to match internal\nrescaling), while several large sources of contam (eg: Zot traps) were\nlowered somewhat to account for an equivalent level of contam being more\ndangerous. Irradiate's top-end was divided by 5, but the *average* lowered\nsomewhat, to account for low yellow being more dangerous. The average\nnumber of mutations gained by casting 4 times in a row should be similar to\nbefore.\n\n---------------\n\nNew contamination explosion vfx made by regret-index, remixing CanofWorms's\nirradiate explosion vfx.",

For instance,\n'acquire weapon ego:distortion' on a character with high ranged weapon\nskill has such a low chance to find a compatible base type on each attempt\nthat it frequently runs out of rerolls and gives up, returning a random\nweapon instead.

(It would have been possible\nfor this to prevent Xom from being in a good mood, but I know regret-index\nwants to eventually make adjustments to how Xom mood works altogether, and\nshe was in favor of Xom not interacting with it for now.

      "message": "Adjust a handful of things about Corrupting Pulse and tempmuts in general\n\nCorrupting used a mix of multiple different types of LoS check in its code,\nresulting in various weirdnesses:\n -It couldn't hit through grates (inexplicably), but the tracer thought it\n  could, resulting in wretched stars repeatedly flashing at the player with\n  no effect.\n -The flash was drawn as if it could pass through fog, but it could not.\n\nNow it works through grates, as one would expect, and the code should be\nslightly cleaner. Additionally, friendly wretched stars can no longer\nmutate the player (they already couldn't do it to allied monsters!), so\nthey are no longer barred from casting it.\n\nIn the hope of slightly improving clarity of what negative mutations are\nactually affecting the player at any given time, monsters are now less\nlikely to cast Corrupting Pulse against a player who is already heavily\ntempmutated.\n\nThe formula for recovery time for tempmuts has been greatly simplified.\nIt is no longer based upon XP (with a sliding cost depending on current\nXL), but rather a small number of kills of 'non-trivial' monsters, which is\neasier to balance lasting a predictable length of time at various XLs.\nTempmuts are supposed to be very short compared to banes, but the current\ncosts could wipe out half of a player's tempmuts in a single kill\nsometimes, which is a bit much. The formula for how many mutations are\nremoved at a single time has also been simplified. Overall it is now:\n -Every 4-7 kills, 2-3 tempmuts will be removed.\n\nFinally, weak, clumsy, dopey, and berserkitis are no longer in the pool of\ntempmuts - the first 3 because they are irrelevantly weak in the span of a\ncouple fights, and the last because it is very easy to overlook gaining in\nthe midst of gaining many tempmut until the player actually goes berserk,\nby which point it may be too late to do anything about. In my opinion, this\nis a generally unsatisfying way to threaten the player; many other badmuts\ndon't require *proactively* changing your behavior in this manner.\nmy opinion.",

      "message": "Improve some mutation conflict code\n\nCode to handle certain types of directly-conflicting mutations was written\nin a somewhat opaque fashion, and had special handling for cases that I\nthink are no longer relevant.\n\nThere are now only 2 types of mutation conflict pairs: those which are\n'inverse' of each other (like Fraile/Robust) that subtract existing levels\nfrom the other mutation when one is gained, and those which are\nfundamentally incompatible (like Low Magic / HP casting) and which will\nveto the new mutation unless it is forced.\n\nThe distinctions of 'delete one level if forced' vs. 'delete all levels if\nforced' do not seem relevant since perma_mutate *already* deletes all\nlevels of conflicting mutations, and god-gifted normal mutations are\ngenerally random and thus not important specifically what you get.\n\nBesides refactoring, this also changes the conflict category of several\nmutations. Elemental resistance and vulnerability mutations are now\nconsidered inverse of each other, rather than incompatible (it is not clear\nwhy this was ever the case). This means it is now possible for, eg, djinn\nto tempmut fire vulnerability or white draconians to tempmut cold\nvulnerability.\n\nEvolution/devolution and rMut/devolution were previously considered inverse\nof each other, but rMut/evolation were incompatible. They are now all\ninverse.",

      "message": "Make neqoxecs apply temp mutations instead of full ones (hellmonk)\n\nWhile fear and player dissatisfaction over getting malmutated by neqoxecs\nmay be outsized compared to the real threat those mutations present, it\ndemonstrably has an effect on how players even *discuss* Extended (and,\nfor instance, the percieved importance of death form in Pan). Pan is due\nfor significant changes this version that may recontextualize a lot of\nthat anyway, but their use in 3-rune games is arguably awkward: a rare\nresult from a handful of summoners that is very unlikely to do anything to\nyou, but with that thin sliver of a chance of feeling very unfun to some\npeople.\n\nI don't think there's a terrible lot of value in preserving the tiny chance\nto get, say, berserkitis in Orc:2 (and I hope to do a series of things in\n0.34 to make counterplay against bad mutations feel more agentive and\n'push your luck' in general), so let's try making them inflict temporary\nmutations instead.\n\nInstead of Malmutate, they now cast Warp Body: a line-of-fire requiring\nspell that inflicts a temp mutation and a small amount of damage (1d7).\nBut if the player already has 3 different tempmuts, they become Vitrified\ninstead of getting a 4th mutation. This keeps the mutation list from\ngetting too large to internalize, while also creating a more immediate\nthreat to endanger the player (especially if multiple neqoxecs are\ncooperating together in Pan). Let's see how this feels!\n\n-----------------\n\nWarp Body spell icon by regret-index, combining ontoclasm's Ice Form tile\nand NormalPerson7's Malmutate tile.",

      "message": "Reflavor Dazzling Flash -> Gloom, refactor blind resistances everywhere\n\nBlindness checks were a little weird/messy, both in-code and in-game. There\nwere separate functions for can_be_blinded() and can_be_dazzled() - the\nlatter of which was approximately, but not entirely, 'can be blinded by\nlight-based effects'. Also, 'blindness immunity' in living monsters\nsuperceded other resists in a way that sometimes felt odd - like Enfeeble\nbeing able to blind unknowable eldritch beings without any recognizable\nanatomy but *not* a regular dog. Finally, while b856850 making wands of\nlight work against exactly the exact same set of creatures as Dazzling\nFlash was good from an intuitiveness perspective, it will run into the\nweird issue later in 0.34 of light beams from holy creatures being\nineffective against undead, which feels like *very* incorrect flavor.\n\nIn an attempt to allow the power of holies to work against undead without\ncreating other inconsistencies, this commit reflavors Dazzling Flash\nentirely, as well as unifying a number of resist checks and trying to lay\nout more universal rules about how blindness works on monsters.\n\nactor::res_blind() now has 2 levels, corresponding with the following\nrules:\n -Physical means of blinding (darkness, ink, atropa, pies in the\n  face...) work only on natural/demonic/holy monsters.\n -Light can additionally blind undead creatures (whether we consider wands\n  of light explicitly holy or not, the traditional associations are very\n  strong - and will be even moreso when the spelll is cast by a future holy\n  monster)\n -Enfeeble and most direct divine powers can work on *anything*,\n  overpowering the blind-immune property of dogs, deep trolls, etc.\n  Assume that curses like Enfeeble are not affecting just visual senses,\n  but perception in general.\n\nDazzling Flash is now called Gloom, and is Hexes/Necromancy, blinding\nthrough dark instead of light. It is functionally unchanged beyond its\nschools - however, being part-Necromancy is arguably a much better fit for\nthe effect than Fire ever was (...it's just that Fire was a quick fix to it\nbeing Conjurations, which made even less sense....). Outside of flavor\nreasons, it can synergize with undead allies to provide defensive cover and\nnecromancy was always a reasonably-popular option to give stabbers answers\nfor unstabbable things.\n\nOther gameplay-impacting changes:\n -Wands of light can now blind undead again. This doesn't feel\n  unreasonable, given the ammo considerations, and can sometimes provide an\n  option that low-level hexes do not.\n -Enfeeble now works on a handful of creatures it did not previously - most\n  meaningfully high-level jellies and deep trolls. While this is helpful,\n  I suspect it's not by enough to be overly flattening.\n -Divine Shield can no longer blind non-living or unblindable monsters.\n  This was not done for balance reasons, but consistency with the rules for\n  light-based effects. Possibly the ability or TSO could get a slightly\n  upward nudge in some other way, if it's felt warranted.\n -Recite and Ru Retribution can now blind any monster (Zin would even\n  previously waste time *trying* to blind monsters it would never work\n  against, which was not obvious with how the code was structured.)\n -Cloak of Starlight now can affect undead (which seems fine to me)\n\nNote that non-living *player* species are still fully vulnerable to being\nblinded; player non-livingness is... ever more weird and often quite\ndifferent than how it works on monsters in general, which is something I\nplan to change/clarify in a later commit. Player undead should fully obey\nthe same rules as monster undead.\n\n(I have also moved dazzling flash code - now gloom - into spl-monench.cc\ninstead of spl-damage.cc, which was a remnant of when Dazzling Spray was\nactually a conjurer spell foremost.)\n\n-------------------\n\nGloom spell tile by regret-index, composited from Denzi's old Abjuration\nicon plus ontoclasm's previous Dazzling Flash tile.

No such spell has existed\nfor a very long time, and I cannot imagine we would choose to create\nanother, so it seems best to remove this.\n\n(Though as always, with a refactor of this nature, it's possible this is\nsome localized effect I have overlooked, although I've tried to be\nthorough.)",

Worse, sometimes it wasn't; monster hex success chance\nin xv relied on the expectation that monster hexes would divide their power\nby 3 in their zaps, but there was no structural obligation to do so and a\nfew hexes, such as Mindburst or Soul Splinter, used a different factor to\ncontrol their power, resulting in xv showing an incorrect success chance.\n\nxv additionally assumed that all monster hex power would be capped at 200,\nthough most spells do not do this (as monster spells do not in general).\nPossibly no monster in a normal game can actually get power that high, but\na few Sprint monsters do exceed that (resulting in xv underestimating their\nsuccess chance.)\n\nFinally, a handful of monster hexes did *actually* cap their power at 200,\nwhich I consider inconsistent with monster behavior in general. Eidolons\nactually hit this cap with their Cause Fear, meaning that brilliance\nunexpectedly would have no effect upon it. I have removed this behavior\nfrom all monster hexes to which it applied (Cause Fear, Mesmerise, Mass\nConfusion, Dominate Undead, Doom Howl, Siren Song, and Confusion Gaze). I\nthink the only other cases in normal play where it may be possible to\nexceed the old cap are brilliant glowing orange brains and brilliant\nvampire bloodprinces? But who knows what the future might hold?\n\nI've tried to be careful to otherwise preserve current formulas and success\nrate, though some oversights may still be possible.\n\n(There are additional problems with xv lying about the success chance of\nmonster hex wands, which will be addressed in a subsequent commit.)",

      "message": "Change Daze effect, use it to fix numerous issues with Gozag's gold aura\n\nDaze was a fairly rarely-used status effect that, in practice, was\nbasically a slightly worse slow that produced more message spam (skipping\n1-in-4 turns at random versus 1-in-3 turns consistently). It was sometimes\nused in place of Slow for variety's sake, but wasn't very distinctive.\n\nThis commit converts it to a form of crowd-control that deliberately does\n*not* enable stabbing opportunities on its own, which is something that\nhas highly biased many crowd-control-style effects in Crawl in past -\nmaking them primarily valuable as instakill-enablers instead of for any\ndefensive properties, and forcing us to be conservative with allowing the\nplayer access to them for the same reason.\n\nDaze is now very similar to 'Sleep, if it didn't enable stabs or reduce\ndefenses' - the monster will pass its turns in place, ignoring noise or\nother alerts, until the effect expires or a hostile action is taken against\nit. (There is a 1-turn grace period when it is first applied where it\ncannot be broken, largely to keep spells like Enfeeble from immediately\nbreaking their own effects.)\n\nExisting effects that applied daze now do so for a much shorter length of\ntime. (And I believe there is some future design room opened up for other\neffects to apply it in different ways.)\n\nDaze can now also be applied to the player for the same effect, in\nanticipation of a future commit that will make use of this.\n\nFinally: since daze's new effect is nearly functionally identical to\nENCH_GOLD_LUST (used by Gozag's golden aura), the latter has been folded\ninto it and deprecated, which fixes multiple significant issues that it\nhad. Namely:\n -While ENCH_GOLD_LUST was used for the 'skip the next 1-5 turns' effect,\n  the presence or absence of this debuff was literally invisible to the\n  player, having neither an icon nor text on examining a monster. The\n  effect could only be *inferred* by the monster simultaneously being\n  distracted. *However*, the distraction effect (applied alongside\n  ENCH_GOLD_LUST by setting the monster's foe to MHITNOT) almost always\n  ended prematurely if multiple monsters were around (as it could be\n  broken by any noise or many other minor things), making it extremely\n  unclear that the monster was still stunned and generally making it look\n  like the aura was far less effective than it was.\n -As noted above, the distraction part of this effect was very brittle,\n  and also separate of the stunning. As Daze now more thoroughly keeps\n  monsters from responding to alerts, using Daze here should keep them\n  distracted for the overall duration of the effect.\n\nAside from the important effect of stopping the UI from flagrantly lying to\nthe player about what the aura was actually doing, explicitly using Daze\nwill have the following mechanical effects:\n -It will be marginally easier to attempt distraction stabs with Gozag,\n  due to distraction being less brittle (though not to a degree that I\n  expect to be significant, since it will still break on the first\n  attempt).\n -As a visible debuff, the aura will now trigger poltergeist's Trickster\n  effect. This is rather more significant, though hopefully not to a\n  problematic degree (it still pales compared to how many debuffs Usk can\n  put out in the same span of time, after all).\n\n(Finally, this commit also stops Gozag's aura from affecting monsters on\nthe other side of glass.)",

      "message": "Make Enfeeble apply Diminished Spells to monsters instead of antimagic\n\nThe way Enfeeble applied antimagic to monsters was somewhat unintuitive and\npoorly-conveyed. Antimagic is a status that cares heavily about being\nrepeatedly stacked, with its chance of blocking a spell being dependant on\nhow much duration remains. But Enfeeble, unlike every other player source\nof antimagic, DOESN'T stack - each cast will roll the effect duration and\nincrease it only if the remaining duration is less. This means that\nrepeatedly casting the spell will, on average, do very little to impair a\nmonster's spellcasting any more than the first cast did. This isn't really\ncommunicated by the game at all (and directly affects how the spell should\nactually be used).\n\nWhile an argument could be made that antimagic's internal mechanics could\nalso be changed or communicated better, applying Diminished Spells instead\nhas a more transparent effect that naturally does not stack (and mirrors\nthe Weak the spell already applies). And, importantly, is something that\ncan be done to the player without being direct MP drain, for a pending\nmonster version of the spell.",

      "message": "Revise derived-undead skeletons into uncommon Doom-spreading draugr\n\nMonster skeletons have always struggled to differentiate themselves from\nzombies in meaningful mechanical capacities beyond their visual flavour\nand LRD vulnerability, especially with the removal of player-accessible\nskeletons with the current state of Necromancy spells dropping such in\nc2cd7fe. Said flavour has a certain innate appeal to vary up a large\nnumber of older vaults and Crypt with various different types of scaling\nundead, so revamping it entirely in a fashion that can somewhat preserve\nthe many different tiles is reasonable; much of the undead available in\nthe game have some difficulties with variety also matching their placement\nacross nearly the whole game, so a stronger version is also warranted.\n\nDraugr are a new type of derived undead effectively completely replacing\nmonster skeletons, though not any of the other skull-slash-skeleton themed\nmonsters such as skeletal warriors. These Norse cursebound corporeal and\nmystic undead have a rather more disjoint appearance than prior skeletons,\nmixing gnarled wood into their fragmented skeletal appearance to hopefully\nbe instantly recognizable as something different (and leaning off of the\nliteral use of the word as \"wood\" in the common poetic connection of trees\nto humans and draugr to felled trees in Old Norse, and to fit in a little\nof their original shapeshifting capacities). They do indeed vary quite\nnoticeably, leaning on the cursing of Grettir:\n\n * They have fairly low health versus their HD compared to their previous\n   amounts, much lower than zombies, slightly lower than spectrals, a bit\n   higher than simulacra, and even less EV than the other undead. In\n   exchange, they get +10 AC, both leaning into their LRD weakness and\n   other means of ignoring such to promote a more tangible defensive\n   profile difference between the two non-elemental derived undead here.\n\n * They don't lose any speed compared to their base type, like spectrals\n   and unlike zombies, simulacra, or old skeletons. While it's a notable\n   differentiation piece and flavourful alike to make derived undead worse\n   than their base types, much effort was put into making only fast undead\n   spawn for earlygame unless otherwise specified, which limits a lot of\n   the actual capacity to actually make monsters derived from other\n   monsters. (They do keep an inability to use stairs, though.)\n\n * No matter what type of monster they're based off of, their gnarls of\n   envious wood can wield weapons, using the skeletal warrior weapon set\n   outside of early vault placements. They use it for exactly one\n   Doom-inflicting attack, which scales to their HD rather than the rest\n   of their melee capabilities, and still get to attack with their other\n   usual melee hits otherwise. This is meant to both help there be an\n   option for a game-long source of Doom to make its slower increment\n   process reasonably matter all game long, and also to make them notable\n   as far more damaging in melee compared to zombies in exchange for their\n   relative frailty (while still sturdier than comparative and extremely\n   common simulacra.)\n\nDraugr inherit the current skeleton behaviour of mostly being placed by\nvaults, in bands, or naturally within Crypt. They are placed at a somewhat\nlower count and deeper starting placement than previous skeletons in many\ndifferent vaults, due to essentially adding a new relevant enemy in spots\notherwise using two seperate skins for the same generic derived undead.\nThey have been removed from necromancer bands, but skeletal warrior bands\ncan have exactly one of their warriors replaced with a draugr to try and\nmake them a bit less monotonously singular. Aside from their curse-based\nflavour spreading Doom a bit further, this should somewhat help with\nCrypt's current reputation of being both very uneven and a place one can\nwork off experience-gated strategic damage, both lifting up some of its\nthreat and threatening with its own capacity to inflict such.\n\nThe draugr implementation was done by DracoOmega, with regret-index both\nadjusting their vault usages, cleaning up a fair bit of other skeleton\ncode, and making new tiles. Said tiles are all derived from the original\nskeleton tiles by roctavian, Sastreii, Denzi, Aygtets, and Robsoie.",

      "message": "Add Bane of the Reckless\n\nThis sets the player's SH to 0 (and lasts a relatively long time). Since\nthis obviously does nothing to some players, it will only be given to a\nplayer who currently has non-temporary SH (which does include amulets of\nreflection or Qazlal worship). Since it can be 'mitigated' by different\nequipment setups, the hope is that the duration will sometimes result in\nplayers temporarily choosing different item sets than they would otherwise\n(such as using a two-hander for a while).\n\nIt only being given to players who have SH at the time the bane is applied\n*technically* makes it possible to game this, but I'm not convinced this\nis actually beneficial (such as taking off a shield you're actually using,\nwhile fighting a doom user, so that you... won't have a tiny chance of\nlosing the SH bonus that you just voluntarily lost at the cost of 5 turns\nsitting still and instead get something possibly worse?)",
